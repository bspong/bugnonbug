FireFox works, but seems to have disabled all Netscape 7.2 functions (totally inoperative now)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I installed FireFox, and got all the settings established.  The browser seems to
work perfectly.  However, now Netscape 7.2 won't work at all.  I click on the
icon, but the application simply won't start.  However, I can use my older
Netscape 4.8 for e-mail and browsing, but I usually use it only for mail.  I
used 7.2 for browsing as 7.2 is peculiar when doing e-mail.  I also have Opera,
IE6, SlimBrowser, and Neoplanet, all of which work normally.  Repeated deletions
and re-installs of 7.2 won't solve the problem.  Everything else on our XP
system works normally.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Simply click the Netscape 7.2 browser icon
2.  The system does something for several seconds (lights flash)
3.  The 7.2 splash screen does not appear, & the application does not begin

Actual Results:  
Nothing.  The system contimues to function normally in every respect.  I noticed
the problem only after I installed FireFox.  Until then, 7.2 worked perfectly. 
I tried uninstalling Firefox, re-installing.  Then I did the same for 7.2 and
got the same results:  FireFox works and now Netscape 7.2 does npt.  This is not
a major handicap as I have redundant browsers, but I would like to get 7.2 back.

Expected Results:  
Perhaps something was deleted (shared file?) when I uninstalled FireFox,
something Netscape needed.  But then re-installs should have taken care of this.
 The only thing I can think of is that uninstalling FireFox perhaps deleted a
"system" something / application, one that does not comewith either FireFox or
Netscape.  I have no indicators as to what may be "missing", if anything.

No crash.
