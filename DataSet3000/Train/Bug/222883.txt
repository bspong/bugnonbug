The ManageFolder control does not allow to create the first subfolder.  When it
is initially empty, added subfolders are located somewhere else in the heierarchy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks=>ManageBookmarks;
2. Select an EMPTY folder into which you would like to add a subfolder;
3. Right-select ManageFolder: the ManageFolder dialog is displayed;
4. Click the control "New Folder": a dialog is displayed prompting for the name
of the new folder. enter a suitable name, click OK.
5. OBSERVE: the canvas of the ManageFolder control does NOT show the new folder. 
Browse around the bookmarks and you will find your new folder at the bottom of
one of the enclosing folders.

Actual Results:  
See point 5 above

Expected Results:  
The new folder should be created as a subfolder of the ManageFolder subject. 
The new folder should appear on the canvass of the ManageFolder dialog.

NOTE: If the ManageFolder subject is NOT initially empty, things work as they
should.
