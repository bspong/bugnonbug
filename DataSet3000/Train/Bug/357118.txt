Window frozen when resizing text on a long page

When I am on http://www.plope.com/Books/2_7Edition/AppendixB.stx and I try to resize text, using Command-"+" or Command-"-", the Firefox window "freezes": the first resize step is only partially completed (part of the page still stays at the default size), and then all further redraw operations seem to be blocked; the application seems to be still alive, as the window title changes if I select a different tab, and menus are working (I can happily quit Firefox), but the window content is not updated anymore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.plope.com/Books/2_7Edition/AppendixB.stx ;
2. After the page has loaded, press Command-"-" (the Apple key + the minus sign) to reduce text size.
Actual Results:  
Only the left part of the page is resized, resulting in a "broken" view, and then the window contents are not updated anymore: the rendered page always stays the same if I change text size again or reset it to the default (Command-0), if I switch to a different tab, if I go back in tab history, etc...

Expected Results:  
The text size should have been reduced correctly and then everything should have continued working as usual.

Tested on Firefox 2.0RC3 with a fresh new profile, all default settings.
I suppose it's a general problem with very long pages, but I can't be sure, I know no other similar pages where to test it.
