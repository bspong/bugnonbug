"Open in tabs" in bookmarks closes all existing tabs without warning, even if
multiple tabs are open and you have "Warn when closing multiple tabs" turned on
in the Firefox configuration.

Middle-clicking on a folder in the bookmarks toolbar will do an "Open in tabs".
 It is very easy to accidentally middle-click on one of these, because I usually
middle-click bookmarks.  Contrary to what you would expect, middle-clicking a
folder in the bookmarks doesn't open them in new tabs but closes all existing
tabs and replaces them.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools > Options > Advanced > Browsing and make sure "Warn when closing
multiple tabs" is turned on.
2. Middle click a folder in your bookmarks.


Actual Results:  
All my open tabs are gone and replaced with new tabs for the folder entries

Expected Results:  
Display warning first (or open the new tabs *in addition to* the current tabs).

Classifying this as a bug rather than enhancement since the "Warn when closing
multiple tabs" feature is broken here.
