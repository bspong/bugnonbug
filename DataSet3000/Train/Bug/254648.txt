I have my system set up in such a way that I use the keyboard for nearly
everything.  I use the numeric keypad to move the mouse around, and discovered
caret mode (F7) mode today.  It's great to be able to use the arrow keys to move
around the text in the page and select links and text in this way.

One thing I have problems with is clicking buttons.  While I can move the caret
onto the button, I can't click on it easily, and end up having to move the mouse
anyway.  If I had another shortcut (control-f7 or the like) to jump the mouse
pointer to the caret, I could then move the mouse slightly if necessary using
the keypad and then click on the button. This would help my navigation
significantly.

Thanks for a great product with great features.
