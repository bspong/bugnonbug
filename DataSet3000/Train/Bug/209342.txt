browser window position always (0,0) ? [gtk2]

I'm using mozilla-firebird 0.6... it works great...

There is only one weirdness:

A new browser window (also the default window when starting MozillaFirebird)
will always open at (0,0) at the top left corner of the screen here...

I don't know why, even the localstore.rdf *has* stored the last used position
into screenX, screenY for chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#main-window,
which I assume means that window?

Also, parameter "-geometry" doesn't work/exist... is there a X resource to set
the position ?

What I'm getting at, the way it is now, the Mozilla Firebird browser window is
partially beneath my (system) panel which is a lil weird... so I want to set it
to (0,50)... how ?

Other than that its nice :)


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
window opens and get placed (by firebird itself, it seems) at the top left
corner, at (0,0)

or
