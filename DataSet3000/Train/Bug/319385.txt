Annoying display for blocked hosts: "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at foo.net."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I block annoying hosts with a hosts file. In the good old days of Firefox 1.0.x an innoccuous blank area would show instead of the advertisement. But now Firefox 1.5 displays a message that's almost as annoying as the blocked advertisement. 

Some people might regard this behavior as a feature. I don't. At least provide an option to turn it off.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install hosts file from http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm
2. Go to http://finance.yahoo.com/ and look in the top right corner. There's usually a blocked ad in that position.
3.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla showed me a box with a big blue border, containing a big exclamation mark in a yellow triangle, with the words "Unable to connect" "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ad.doubleclick.net."

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should have shown me a box of pure pristine white space.
