many websites crash on pressing 'submit'-type javascript buttons

Unfortunately, this bug is not consistantly reproducable; it just happens every
now and again (probably about once a day under reasonably heavy load). When I
press a 'submit'-style button (recent examples include the Chat Room under
http://www.rondaksportal.com/citizens/index.php3 and 'Go' at
http://www.kwiz.biz/showpoll.php?pollid=3902), the browser simply shuts down
completely, disappearing as if kill -9'ed. However, it happens rarely enough
that it does not often happen twice with the same button.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do lots of web-quizzes.
2. Keep pressing Javascript-style 'submit' buttons.
3. Eventually, the browser will close suddenly.

Actual Results:  
Every day or so, the browser will close suddenly with no warning (taking all its
tabs with it and all other Firefox windows) directly after pressing one of the
buttons.

Expected Results:  
Taken me to the page containing the results of pressing the button.

I don't recieve any error messages; is there something I should turn on so that
I do?
