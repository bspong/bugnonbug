Yahoo Mail no longer works for me with Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I use Yahoo Mail exclusively.  Firefox enabled me to use Yahoo Mail fine for
about one year until about six weeks ago when the Yahoo Mail address
autocomplete stopped working and I found that certain of the Yahoo Mail buttons
no longer worked (for example, the Reply button does not work, nor does the
attach file button).  I do not get an error messages but nothing happens either
and the command is not executed.

My Internet Explorer works fine on all of these operations so it seems to me
there must be some configuration issue that I do not understand.  However, it
did work fine previously.
