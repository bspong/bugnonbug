Text box containing carriage return halts at first carriage return.

If a text box value contains a carriage return, the remaining value past the
carriage return does not display. In the example below, the html equivalent for
a carriage return (&#13;) is entered in a text box:

<input type="text" name="T1" size="20" value="line 1&#13;line 2
line 3">

The resulting text box will only display [line 1] and nothing beyond.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter "Line 1 &#13; Line 2" for the VALUE property of an input type="text".
2.View the page in Firefox. Only the words "Line 1" are displayed in the text box.
3.View the page in another browser (ex I.E.). The carriage return is not visible
however all other data in the value property is. "Line 1Line2"

Actual Results:  
All data past the carriage return has been removed from the text box

Expected Results:  
The carriage return should have been ignored and both "Line 1" and "Line 2"
should have displayed.

Although the severity of this bug is set to NORMAL, the bug, in my opinion,
should be escalated. Many text boxes are populated with values queried from a
database. This would render a text box ineffective if used for updating a DB field.
