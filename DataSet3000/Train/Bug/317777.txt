our oracle corporate time server generates pages with html like the following:

<HTML>
<BODY>
<FORM NAME="login" ACTION="/foo.pl" METHOD="POST">
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="location" SIZE="22" MAXLENGTH="32" VALUE="\0">
</FORM>
</BODY>
</HTML>

the actual html file returned by the server contains NUL (ascii 0) in place of the \0 above. 

the problem is that firefox won't let me enter text into the input field. i can click on the input field, and the field becomes focused. but i can't enter any text.

i can work-around the problem, though, by first hitting left-arrow, and then entering the text. (backspace and delete can also be used to work around the problem, but right-arrow can not.)
