The clickable area of the back button is smaller now than previously.

The new back button appears to have a 5px wide gap to the left of it which is not-clickable.

In addition to this, 14px on the right hand side are dedicated to the down arrow for dropping down the history.

This results in the clickable area being relatively small and will increase the rate of misses.

In my opinion, the user should be able to move his mouse pointer to the very left hand edge of that toolbar, which when maximised is the left hand side of the screen, and click, however currently the user will need to move it to the left hand edge and then back 5 pixels to the right, or stop the mouse pointer 5 pixels from the edge, which requires more effort.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click in the small gap to the left of the back button

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Back button click, back operation.

Wasn't sure whether to mark as trivial or enhancement, chose trivial as this represents something that used to work better.
