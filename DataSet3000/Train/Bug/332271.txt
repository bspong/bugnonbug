One cause of wrong tab closure identified in tab closure handling (Ctrl+F4 bubbles although being handled)

I don't know if this is the cause of all the time I've had a desired tab close when I wasn't expecting it, but it's a confirmed cause of many of them and needs fixing.

Suppose you open a new tab. A blank tab appears and the focus is taken to the address bar for entry of the desired address. Whilst entering the address you decide actually you don't need that page after all. So you close it, with the normal key combination for "close tab".

Then not only your new blank tab is closed, but also the NEXT tab is closed as well. If you only had one tab open prior to the above, FF itself shuts down too.

It is obvious that logically what has happened is that the edge case where the current tab is newly displayed blank but no web page has yet loaded into it, is not correctly processed in the "close tab" function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See above.
Actual Results:  
See above. 
A second tab is closed that was not directed to be closed. Data is lost.

Expected Results:  
Existing valid tabs should not close when the current tab is closed.

I have also had many cases (harder to reproduce) where a current tab being worked on has closed and pathologically, a second previous tab has closed too. Most of these were not new tabs. So probably there is a second bug in this function with similar effect. Please when rechecking this function look for other cases by which a 2nd tab might accidentally be closed when the close-tab function is used.
