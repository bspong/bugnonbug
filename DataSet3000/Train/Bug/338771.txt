After let browser for two days with multiple tab opened (3 instances of Firefox with around 12 tab each), I opened http://www.ajaxload.info/ and start to preview gif images. I opened some new tabs with another urls and gone back to ajaxload.info and the gif animation have stopped, then load a some new gif and the same happens. Curiously, that page contains about ten animated gif and all are animated but preview part didn't work, and i opened a new tab with again http://www.ajaxload.info/ and all seems to work correctly. So I can't reproduce this behavior in another window or tab.

(Sorry for my bad english)
