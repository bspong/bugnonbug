Firefox crashes when viewing email (composed in Incredimail ) through Mediacom Webmail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

When using Mediacom's webmail at https://commcenter.mchsi.com/, Firefox crashes
when attempting to open any email composed with non-premium versions of program:
Incedimail.  

Non-premium versions of Incredimail include external link to images such as
"http://www2.incredimail.com/contents/stamps/clapnuts.gif" at bottom of messages.  

When doing same in Internet Explorer, clicking on email produces two identical
Security Information dialog boxes that ask: "This page contains both secure and
nonsecure items.  Do you want to display the nonsecure items?"  After clicking
yes to both boxes, message is displayed as expected.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Incredimail email program from www.incredimail.com
2.Send email to Mediacom (name@mchsi.com) email address using Incredimail
3.Attempt to view email in Mediacom Webmail at https://commcenter.mchsi.com/

Actual Results:  
Firefox closes abruptly and without warning.  (Having multiple tabs open does
not affect Firefox's closing.)

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have displayed webpage (of webmail's email message) without
crashing.  Security dialog about page containing both secure and not secure
items would also be expected if browser were to not crash.

I'm willing to provide a temporary Mediacom email addres to devs who would like
it for testing purposes.
