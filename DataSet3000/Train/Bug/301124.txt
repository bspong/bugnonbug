Browser crashes upon opening, and talkback opens to report the problem; browsing is impossible.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.23; Mac_PowerPC)
Build Identifier: 

I downloaded fx from the link, www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/, and instruct 
my computer to save the file with a dmg extension, because my computer does not 
seem to recognize this extension.  After unpacking the file and dragging the fx 
icon to my harddrive AND my dock, i click on the icon in the dock, it bounces 
briefly, and then apple talkback replaces the fx icon and sends a system crash 
report.  It might be helpful for you to know that i have made the classic 
mistake of double clicking the icon in the dialogue box to try to open the 
browser, rather than opening from the dock, but I have totally removed fx, re-
downloaded, and still have the problem.  I have read the helpful tips that 
instruct to "open a terminal and type 'killall firefox-bin'", but i do not know 
what a terminal is or how to open one.

surf the net.
