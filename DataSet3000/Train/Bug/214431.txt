In the Privacy preferences, I would like to be able to select the following:

- silently accept cookies for the current session only
- ask before accepting for all other cookies

This gives me a better balance between automatically accepting all cookies
(which allows long-term tracking by arbitrary web sites) and being prompted to
accept every single cookie (making web browsing cumbersome).

I suggest a preferences GUI such as the following. This would still allow all
the behaviours which are currently available, as well as supporting the
behaviour I am looking for:

[x] Enable Cookies

    For cookies that last only until the end of the session
        [x] Accept only from the originating web site
        [x] Ask permission before accepting

    For cookies that are saved between sessions
        [x] Accept only from the originating web site
        [x] Ask permission before accepting
