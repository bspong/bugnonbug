Running Windows XP 64 bit edition customer preview, on an Athlon 64 3200+ cpu. 
Firefox seems to work perfectly with every other site I've been to except
http://www.ct.gov/DRS.  As soon as the last image renders, the entire computer
completely blanks out and restarts.  The page loads fine in Internet Explorer,
and loads fine in Firefox in normal Windows XP Pro (32 bit).  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Windows XP 64 bit edition
2. Run Firefox
3. Go to http://www.ct.gov/DRS

Actual Results:  
Computer reboots.

Expected Results:  
Load the page without restarting.

Everything was set as Firefox default, the installation is only 2 days old. 
Windows Error Reporting says "The computer crashed because of a driver, but we
are unable to tell what exactly caused the problem."  The problem only occurs in
Firefox, and only when going to that specific website.  Again, this is Windows
XP 64 bit edition, not regular XP Home or Pro, both of which load the page fine
with Firefox.
