After downloading the English Windows XP Installer file from the FireFox website
(http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) I experience an error when trying to
run the installer file. The file downloaded as: Firefox Setup 1.0 exe on to my
desktop. After the file completed downloading, I double clicked on the installer
file icon which was on my desktop which results in the following:

A small dialog window pops up with the title: 7-Zip in the window bar. Inside
the window it reads: Unspecified error and there is an 'OK' button immediately
below that. Clicking the 'OK' button closes the window and nothing else happens.

I have tried downloading the file several times and have restarted my computer
between downloads and still experience the same problem. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ and click on the Download Now
link in the upper right hand corner (if you are using a Windows XP machine).
2. Download the file to the desktop.
3. Double click on the installer file after it finishes downloading

Actual Results:  
I get a small dialog window with and 'Unspecified Error' and an OK button. It
reads 7-Zip in the title bar of the window.

Expected Results:  
The installation process should have started.
