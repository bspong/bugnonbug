Syntax error in the location input field does not trigger a warning message

A user can create a bookmark with syntax errors and not receive a warning
message. After the bookmark the created if it is attempted to be used the user
will receive an Alert message box stating: ht is not a registered protocol (if
using the specific replication instructions below). By including a syntax check
for the location input field at the time of entry the user friendliness of the
browser could be enhanced. This enhancement would be in the form of reduced user
frustration by avoiding after the fact notification requiring the user to return
to the Bookmark manager to correct the syntax error. I compared the
above-described behavior to that of Internet Explorer version 5.50.4807.2300CO.
The design is slightly different, but a similar function (bookmark Properties)
within IE with a location input field (URL: in IE) does provide the user a
Problem with Shortcut warning message if an address with incorrect syntax is
entered into the URL field. 	

Step to replicate Null Entry error message in Internet Explorer:
Favorites --> Right Click on any website --> Select Properties --> Switch to the
Web Documents tab in the Properties Dialog Box --> Delete the entry in the URL
field --> Enter hp://www.anywebsite.com/ --> Click OK


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks --> Manage Bookmarks --> New Bookmark
2. On the info tab, in the location field enter: ht://www.anywebsite.com.
3. Click OK on the Properties of “New Bookmark” dialog box.

Actual Results:  
A warning message was not displayed that there is a syntax error in the location
field.

Expected Results:  
Displayed a warning message that there is a syntax error in the location field.
