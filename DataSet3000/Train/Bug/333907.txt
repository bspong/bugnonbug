If i shut down Windows while FF is running the next time i start FF the session saver of TabMixPlus says that the last session crashed. Nothing unusual can be observed if windows shuts down with FF running. It just exits.

The extension developer says the fault is FF not the extension. It seems that FF exits differently if closed manually then if it was closed by windows on shutdown. The extension doesn't have the ability to write to the config that FF was shut down properly like it does if FF is closed manually.
My Windows installation is set up properly so that programs can shut down and take some time to perform closing functions. But as already said, FF exits immediatly so it isn't killed hardly by Windows because it takes too long to exit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF
2. Restart Windows
3. Restart FF

Actual Results:  
Session saver of TMP says last session crashed, like FF didn't exited properly last time.

Expected Results:  
Nothing, since FF was shutdown properly.
