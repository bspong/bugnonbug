When manually appending http:// into the urlbar, the autocomplete popup refuses
to appear, unless I type backspace after beginning to enter the TLD.  Thus, if I
type http://am, the popup will not appear.  Hitting backspace at this point,
such that http://a is displayed causes autocomplete to appear with all the sites
in the history with a TLD starting with "a".  Note that out of habit I almost
always type in http:// when entering a url.  Immediately typing the beginning of
the url (without prepending http://) causes the popup to appear as expected
(even if http:// appears in the history file).  Thus, typing just "a" in the
urlbar causes http://www.amazon.com as well as all other sites which have a TLD
beginning with "a".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a new tab
2.type http://foo
3.hit the backspace key such that http://fo is displayed
4.all websites with TLDs beginning with "fo" appear.

Actual Results:  
The autocomplete popup appears only after hitting the backspace key

Expected Results:  
The autocomplete popup should appear as soon as I begin typing in the TLD; step
3 should not be necessary.
