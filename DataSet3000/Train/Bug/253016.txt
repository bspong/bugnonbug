Mouseover/Rollover Images No Longer Work -- WinXP SP2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

I hope that this is some easily solvable problem, but ever since I installed RC2
of the Windows XP Service Pack 2 mouseover / rollover images no longer work. For
example, in the above website, the icons on the left (academics, info, etc)
should turn yellow during mouseover. It still does it in IE, but not firefox. As
far as I can tell, this happens to all such images everywhere on the net.

I can try to uninstall XP/SP2 tomorrow at my work machine to correct the problem
and verify that it is the SP that is cauing the difficulty.

I should also note that in IE (with SP2), a warning pops up whenever a page
contains mouseover images, and it attempts to block the javascript (which stops
the images from changing). I really hope that Microsoft didn't force this
"security" feature on all browsers. I have supposedly disabled this feature--now
mouseovers work on IE, but still not in Firefox. :(

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Win XP SP2
2. Go to a web page that contains rollover/mouseover images
3. Note that the images do not change as they should (and do in IE)

Actual Results:  
Nothing Happens (Images do not change)

Expected Results:  
Images should change on mouseover
