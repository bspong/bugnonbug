When you type in keywords in the location bar which is not in history and which is  a non-URL, firefox attempts to do a google search. As a usability enhancement this should be indicated to the user, that he is about to perform a search.
See attachment on how it is implemented in another browser.
This also allows better visibility to this feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox. Type some non-URL keywords. For example "New York Times"
2. Press Go or <Enter>

Actual Results:  
Firefox does a "I am lucky" google search and loads www.nytimes.com.
Doesn't indicate to the user that it is going to do the search. Though it looks like the user should be knowing this, it is polished to inform the user the effects of his intentions.


Expected Results:  
Show "Search For New York Times" in the location bar as soon as New York Times is detected to be a non-URL. See attachment for example.
