Redraw errors after resizing a window containing an applet with 100% width and height
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When using the HTML attached with the applet code:

import javax.swing.JApplet;

public class AppletTest extends JApplet
{
}

(An applet which does nothing other than be an applet)

When a non maximized browser window is resized to a smaller size by dragging the
bottom right corner, the window will sometimes be rendered incorrectly, with
errors including duplicate or absent status bars and scroll bars, missing title
bar and white gaps between components (not necessarily at the same time).  If
the window is minimised via the taskbar and then redisplayed, it is rendered
correctly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load test applet detailed above, into a window which is not maximized but is
reasonably large.
2. Click bottom right of window to enter resizing mode.
3. Drag the window to a smaller size.

The bug seems to be more likely to occur if the resize is done quickly. It also
seems to be less likely to occur if the window resized correctly previously, and
the page has not been refreshed since.

Actual Results:  
Occasionally, the window will redraw incorrectly. An example of this can be seen
at http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~pjf33/firefoxResize.jpeg.

Expected Results:  
Dedrawn the window correctly after resize.
