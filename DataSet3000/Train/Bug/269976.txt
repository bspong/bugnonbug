After clicking on "Email and more" login page does not show

I'm trying to read web-based email from Verizon DSL's web site.  But I can't
even get to the login page because Firefox (and Mozilla actually had the same
problem) seems to not support a javascript method that is being used.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Start browser
1. go to dslstart.verizon.net
2. click on "Email & More"
A blank page shows when it should be showing a login page

Actual Results:  
blank page
and the Javascript console error:
Error: window.navigate is not a function
Source File:
http://sso.verizon.net/portal/protected/LoginSuccessServlet?id_based=yes_rm
Line: 12

Expected Results:  
It should have shown a login page.

I'm not sure where the problem lies, but Firefox and Mozilla have always been
giving me trouble with this site...sometimes, after I hit "reload" I get
to the login page - but after submitting the login/password, again nothing
would happen...maybe the developers only tested with IE :-(
