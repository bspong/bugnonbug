FF hangs is you submit a request to page and there is long processing time before data is received...

I am using a PHPMyAdmin to administer MySQL database on Web server.
But with latest version of FireFox 1.5.0.3 it seems that the browser hangs in the following case:
- you click on operation which causes the PHP/MySQL to execute it a long time (at least 1 minute - like adding indexes on huge tables, or restructuring big tables).
- it seems that the FireFox hangs , because it is not getting response for at least a minute from the web server. And the refreshing of the page is not done although the operation is completed (if you look from other session). Also the CPU load in some of such cases is getting at 100% because of FireFox and is not getting down until you shut down FireFox( which is extremely  bad and unconvinient for usage of browser). 
I found out also that if you open another session of FF and go to page of the same site, is some cases suddenly the earlier opened and already hanged page is loading again, and working... strange, very strange.

In the same cases on the same machine, on the same time and operations , when I try with Internet Explorer 6 the mentioned above bugs does not appear.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find site with PHPMyAdmin and big MySQL tables.
2. Execute a long time consuming query, which causes the browser to not receive response for at least a minute or two.
3. Page is hanged, and sometimes the CPU usage is getting up to 100% because of FireFox process overload, and you have to kill the process to cool thje CPU
