Completed loading of a web page moves cursor out of address bar while typing a url

When a web page finishes loading, the default behavior is to move the cursor to
the first text input box on the page.  Generally, this behavior is appropriate.
 However, if the user is in the process of entering a URL in the address bar, it
can be annoying (since half of the URL ends up in a random text input box).  In
particular, this is a problem when a background tab completes loading.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Begin loading a web page that takes a few seconds to load and has a text
input box somewhere on the page.
2. Open a new foreground tab.
3. Begin typing an address in the address bar.

Actual Results:  
When the first page finishes loading, the cursor goes to the first text input
box on the page, which remains hidden.  Any characters typed will go to the
hidden tab page.

Expected Results:  
The cursor should only move to the first text box of the foreground tab when it
completes loading, not background tabs.
