Status bar icons should be inaccessible (collapsed) when hidden

When the status bar icons (for updates, livemarks, popup blocking, security,
[and style switching if it ever comes back]) are disabled (thus invisible), they
are still accessible by mouseover and click.

Since **you should not be able to interface with invisible items**, something
needs to be changed. [Opinion: The empty placeholder slots look stupid anyway.]

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the strange empty area in the status bar when the popup blocker icon
normally show up.


Actual Results:  
The popup blocker menu pops up out of the strange empty space.

Expected Results:  
Nothing, I think.

When elements that trigger these icons do not exist, one of two things should occur:

1. These elements should take a collaped:true state (like the progress meter
does); or
2. These elements should have a greyed-out icon in place (unlocked security
lock, greyed version of everything else).

Note that if #1 (my personal preference) happens, it is almost exactly the
opposite of bug 251588. If we still want users to be able to initiate update
checking and popup setting when there aren't any pop-ups, #2 is the answer.
