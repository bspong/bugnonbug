Hi there. This is probably mainly a html displaying error im talking about
If you are kind and open the link
http://bakmand.com/Guestbook.aspx
in both firefox and internetexplorer you'll see to major differences, where IE gets it right

1) control only partially visible
When a control (the left tripplearrow at the top) is partially hidden behind another control with transparent background it is still covered. What one would expect is that the partially covered part should be layered in front of the transparent control. IE doesnt make this flaw when showing the same page.

2) TEXTAREA dont fit to contents.
When designing a TEXTAREA control in eg. ASP.NET one can set a parameter wether to use scroolbars and if the control should be fitted to the content. When this TEXTAREA control however resides inside another control wich also is set to auto fit to its contents, the TEXTAREA doesn't make the fit. The difference is visible by comparing how the supplied link displays messages in both IE and Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
In asp, make a web.control.panel and drag a html.control.TEXTAREA onto it. Then set the TEXTAREA control to auto fit and send a textstring to the TEXTAREA control that is larger than the current visible size of the control.
Then it does fit in IE but not in Firefox
