Some servers not accessible after update to 1.5.0.4
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

I just updated Firefox yesterday. I am behind a firewall and I can browse www.mail.com, www.m-w.com, www.yahoo.com, but not https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi neither www.gmail.com.
I have not perceived this behaviour before the update...
With IE 6.0 I have no problem to access the same pages using the same proxy configuration.
The interesting point is that I can reach the page: http://gmail.google.com/mail/help/about.html but not http://gmail.google.com
I can also reach: http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/ but cannot reach:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ neither https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Type www.gmail.com
3.Press Enter

Actual Results:  
The following message appears:
The connection has timed out
The server at bugzilla.mozilla.org is taking too long to respond.
 *   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
    *   If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
          connection.
*   If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Expected Results:  
Forefox should have oppened the page
