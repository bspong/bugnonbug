Sourceforge Bookmark Edit fails
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040120 Firebird/0.8.0+

NOTE: This may be our error or SourceForge's.  It has worked previously, and we
change much more often than they.

If I attempt to change the Name on an existing bookmark at
http://sourceforge.net/my/ , the Edit form is redisplayed with the original
value copied back into the Name field.  The bookmark is unchanged.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
NOTE: YOU WILL NEED A SOURCEFORGE ACCOUNT

1. Select an existing bookmark, click on [Edit];
2. Observe the form display for 'Name', showing Original - <content> and a text
input for your modification;
3. Make some change in the Name;


Actual Results:  
4. Observe the form is redisplayed with the Original content copied back into
the text-input;
5. Return to "My Sourceforge.net" and observe the bookmark is not modified.

Expected Results:  
The redisplayed form should show my modifications both in Original and
Text-Input; the server-stored bookmark should be changed.

SourceForge.net support has also been informed of this.  I cannot readily
discern whether their script or our interpretation of the script is in error.
