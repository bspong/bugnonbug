Please refer to http://www.scif.com/MPN/MPNsearch.html.  We have a frameset with three frames.  The header frame is called "TopFrame" and the body frame is called "MainFrame".  We are pointing MainFrame to a third party web based application.   The "TopFrame" has header links to different sections of the third party web based application.  The Header links in TopFrame must open in MainFrame.  We used the property "Target" to target the frame in which the header links will open (ie. target="MainFrame").  THIS WORKED!  It started not working when we started adding an onclick event to the header links.  The onclick event is firing but the header link is opening in its originating frame (which is the TopFrame) and not on the target frame (MainFrame). 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.scif.com/MPN/MPNsearch.html 
2. Click on one of the Search header links (Radius Search, Name Search, Urgent Care Search, Regional Area Provider Listing and Help)
3. Link opens in the originating frame (TopFrame)
Actual Results:  
When header links are clicked, Link opens in the originating frame (TopFrame)

Expected Results:  
When header links are clicked, link should open in target frame (MainFrame)

We had to add the onclick event on the links in order for us to get web stats.  This is not an issue in I.E. and Netscape.
