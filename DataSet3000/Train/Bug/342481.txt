This has already been reported as bug #328427 HOWEVER I am re-filing the bug as 328427 was marked invalid & resolved for this reason:

Can't mark it invalid based on this as I have reproduced it on two computers, the one I am filing this from and a clean XP install with a clean Firefox install and no extensions.

The bug is fairly well described here:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328427

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://nrkn.com/3ColRoundAlpha/ in Firefox with maximised window
2. Alt-tab to another maximised window for some time, also seems to happen if you are on another tab in Firefox for some time.
3. Return to Firefox

Actual Results:  
Background PNGs with opacity are darker than expected, possibly a gamma issue?

Expected Results:  
Background PNGs should display at the right brightness

I've tried removing the gAMA chunk from the PNG files and it doesn't make any difference.
