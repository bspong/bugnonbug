My cursor moves by itself...always to the left.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: I cannot tell.  See problem below.

My cursor is moving quickly to the left all by itself.  If I attempt to type, I end up typing over anything that I try to type.  It's almost as if my LEFT ARROW button on my keyboard is constantly pushed down. (It's not--that was the first thing I checked).  I have Norton, AVP, and spam-blocking software and I'm pretty sure that it's not virus-related.

I would list my version of Firefox, but I cannot click anything in/near the browser window or on the toolbar (if I try on the toolbar--it constantly moves to the left). I have tried reinstalling FIrefox and it still does it.   I do not have this problem with Internet Explorer.  Sorry, I couldn't give you more specific info on my Firefox build, but I can't click on the HELP/ABOUT portion of the menu window.   

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
When I click on the Firefox icon on windows, Firefox starts as normal.  My homepage is Google.  The cursor is blinking in the Google browser/search window.   When I try to type, the cursor automatically moves to the left;  if I try to highlight/click on a menu item (FILE, EDIT, VIEW, BOOKMARKS, TOOLS, HELP), I can't even click on anything as the highlighted menu option continually moves to the left---when it reaches "FILE"---it resets itself to the extreme right and starts on "HELP" and moves to the far left again.
