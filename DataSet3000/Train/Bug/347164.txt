I've downloaded firefox version for Compaq Unix HP Tru64 v5.1 (but mine is 5.60 and there's no 5.60 version to get) at http://h30097.www3.hp.com/internet/download.htm#firefox1503 and it seems to work well during use but if it is not used for about some minutes, the keyboard seems to does not work anymore just in firefox. Any key typed has no effect. Firefox can be used normally again after the graphical server (X server) is restarted but the problem happens again in the same situation of no using during a period of time. The installation was made using the "setld" command and ran fine. The about dialog box contains: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; OSF1 alpha; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060602 Firefox/1.5.0.4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Don't use it during some time
3.When going to use again the keyboard does not work anymore just in firefox

Actual Results:  
Couldn't type anything in the browser

Expected Results:  
Allow typing

Is it a version problem? At the URL I've downloaded it from HP there are these versions: Tru64 UNIX V5.0A , Tru64 UNIX V5.1 , Tru64 UNIX V5.1A , Tru64 UNIX V5.1B , Tru64 UNIX V5.1B-1 , Tru64 UNIX V5.1B-2 , Tru64 UNIX V5.1B-3.
