www.olympicairlines.com is an airline reservation site. When you choose travel
dates, a calendar pops up. Initially, the calendar popup appears correctly OVER
the browser page. But it doesn't disappear once the date is chosen. It remains
open, which it should not. Then, because it is still open, when you go to choose
a 2nd date for alternate or return travel dates, the calendar popup it is hidden
by the browser. What should happen is that each time a date is clicked on as the
selection, the calendar popup should vanish, then be reopened on top of the
browser when looking for other travel dates.
