In SVG build: window.status does not trigger anymore from JavaScript embedded in SVG
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050329 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050329 Firefox/1.0+

The following script used to work in previous builds of SVG enabled Gecko builds:

<script type="text/javascript">
<![CDATA[
function ShowStatus(Name){if(navigator.appName!="Adobe SVG Viewer")
eval('window.status = " ' + Name + '"'); else browserEval('status = " ' + Name +
'"');}//]]></script>

It's supposed to display a passed parameter in the browser status bar.
It doesn't work anymore, though it has been working flawlessly before, may it be
in IE or Gecko based browsers (i.e. I tested successfully IE, Maxthon, Firefox
SVG and Mozilla SVG).
The test is implemented in order for the script to work in both IE and Gecko
based browsers.
Now, even if I reduce it to:

<script type="text/javascript">
<![CDATA[
function ShowStatus(Name){window.status="Hello world")
}//]]></script>

It still doesn't work in Gecko browsers.

I strongly believe something was broken since nothing changed on my machine
apart from the CSV build used. Unfortunately, I overwrote my previous build.

Yes, I did enable SVG in about:config, and the status bar is indeed showing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an SVG with the code above
2. Over the mouse over a node
3. Status bar does not display anything (though standard links outside SVG do
appear)

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Display the passed parameter in the status bar
