At the top of every bookmarks menu submenu (the main menu is not affected) there is a grayed out option at the top, above the list of bookmarks and subfolders that just says (empty). You can't click on it. Originally I thought it might be from the Add Bookmark Here extension, which is my only bookmarks related extension and I think I had to bump the maxVersion to make it compatible with 2.0b1, but I disabled it and the only change aside from losing its functionality was that live bookmarks only had one of these (empty)s instead of 3 like before. Regular subfolders contained just one either way. These do not appear in the Organize Bookmarks window.

This bookmarks file was taken with me from 1.5.x and I may have accidentally openned this profile in Minefield once or twice, so it was converted to Places format and back again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks menu
2.Open subfolder menu


Actual Results:  
disabled element labeled "(empty)" at the top of the menu

Expected Results:  
just bookmarks
