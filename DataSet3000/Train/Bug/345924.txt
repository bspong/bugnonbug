Carat browsing turns itself on randomly.  I first noticed this when I installed XP x64 and I think it appeared in FF 1.5.0.2 but I am not 100% sure.  It does not happen on my 32bit machines.

It is really annoying because carat browsing will turn on when I am typing in a form and then apostrophes and slashes bring up the find menu and arrow keys stop moving the cursor.  Hitting F7 does bring it out, but sometimes it jumps right back into carat mode within a few dozen seconds.  I am not randomly hitting F7 and if you look at all the bug reports you will see many related to people having  been in carat mode when they thought they were not.    

Extensions I use:
 Gmail Manager
 Forecast Fox Plus
 Adblovk plus w/ filterset

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and several tabs
2.Sooner or later it will happen
3.Happens browsing my Gmail frequently
4. Happens when editing in a wiki often as well

Again it is random but for me it is very frequent




The problem is tab dependant and also randomly goes away wen reloading or clicking on links
