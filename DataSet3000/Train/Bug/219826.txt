some fonts not being loaded properly

In some web pages, it appears that some fonts specified by the web page's HTML
are not being used.  For example, consider this fragment of code:


<html>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS, arial" size="4"><b><strong>
    <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">
    Slashdot!</a>
  </strong></b></font>
<P>
  <font face="comic sans ms, arial" size="4"><b><strong>
    <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">
    Slashdot!</a>
  </strong></b></font>
</html>


As you can tell, only the word "Slashdot!" should appear (twice) in the Comic
Sans MS font (twice to make sure the bug was not a case sensativity issue). 
This did work at one time with Mozilla 1.3.  I had my roommate test this bug out
and for his browser, the bug is not present.  His is Mozilla 1.4:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030908 Debian/1.4-4

The font requested is definitely available to the system, for example The GIMP
can see it and display it without issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
