Generally, when I copy and paste information such as addresses or lines of text on multiple lines, firefox is unable to carry out this simple command.  Internet Explorer, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of doing this.  

This site, http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&StateID=61&City=Vienna&Zip=&Proximity=10, is just one of the numerous sites that has an address on multiple lines.  When I highlight 
"
320 Maple Ave W 
Vienna, VA 22180
"
and copy it to paste it into Google Maps in another tab, the text shown is only the first line.

This is extremely infuriating since it takes multiple times just to copy an address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site.  For example, go to a store and find its location.  A sample is provided at http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&StateID=61&City=Vienna&Zip=&Proximity=10
2. Highlight and copy the address (two lines of text).
3. Go to Microsoft Word or any text field on the internet (in Firefox, of course) and paste.

Actual Results:  
After performing these steps, the same problem still occured - in that only the first line of text was copied.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should have copied the full address (both lines of text).  This works in internet explorer
