Flash Player 7.0.19.0 + Firefox

When Flash loads an external MovieClip or jpg, it can listen to some handlers,
that determine when loading has start, finished or wether there is a load error.

The "onLoadError" handler gets invoked when Flash cannot find the target file to
be loaded. 

Apparently, this handler gets invoked correctly in all browsers I tested, except
Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
-- Requires familiarity with Flash MX 2004 and ActionScript 2.0 --
1. Create a flash movie to load an external jpg using the MovieClipLoader class
2. Create a listener object with the onLoadError handler
3. Load a file which does not exist

Actual Results:  
Despite searching for a non-existent file, the onLoadError event doesn't get
triggered.

Expected Results:  
Flash is looking for a file which does not exist, therefore it invokes the
"onLoadError" handler.

Flash probably relies on the Browser for http requests. I think the problem may
be in the way the browser returns a "load error" whiah the Flash Player doesnt like!

This problem can affct 90% of flash sites out there!!! Most complex flash sites
load content dinamically, and often content is not found... if that function is
not invoked, flash waits endlessly for a return from the server...
