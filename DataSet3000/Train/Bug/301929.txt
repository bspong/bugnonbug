MS's new download Validation routine won't work with my version of Firefix (MOOX)

I've had a series of 11 emails w/ MS tech support persons trying to get their
new validation routine to work for me.  It just goes into a loop asking if I
want to validate. Regardless of whether I decline or provide a current code#
using their "Genuine Advatange" checker, I am not able to get past the
validation questions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  goto (for example) the DL page referenced above for their "Tweak MCE
PowerToy...".
2.  click on the "Continue" button
3.  select "No, do not validate...", and then click "Continue"
4.  click on the "Download" button

Actual Results:  
The 1st page reappears instead of a download process.  The same results happen
if in Step 3 I had selected "Yes, please validate..." and provided a current
validation code.

Expected Results:  
A file download prompt would have appeared for "TweakMCE.msi" with options: 
run, save, cancel.

Based on an 3-page instruction sheet emailed to me by a "Compass Rule Manager"
from <comprule@microsoft.com>, I twice performed system cleanups that was
indicated to assure my WinXP SP2 system was setup properly.
