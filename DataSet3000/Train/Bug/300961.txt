Javascript loading error dialog intermittently when page with frames is reloaded
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

An intermittent error dialog is displayed when reloading a page with frames 
and included Javascript files. The problem occurs more often than not while 
reloading the same page. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox in Safe Mode
2.Enter URL http://www.bayarea.net/~doan/photogallery/sample_strip/index.html 
and Go. Notice that there is no error.
3. Press Reload current page. You might have to do that several times. Most of 
the time you get the error dialog box.
4. When you acknowledge the error by pressing OK, the page loads without 
problem and the Javascript file in question has been loaded correctly.

Actual Results:  
Error dialog:
Error message=Error loading script
URL=...
Line Number = 1

Expected Results:  
The error dialog should not display.

This happens with freshly installed Firefox. I tested versions 1.0, 1.0.5, and 
1.0.6 beta.

I've done some analysis. This problem has nothing to do with the contents of 
the Javascript file. If I substitute it with a different script file that only 
initializes  a variable, it flags that script. If the page of the content 
frame is loaded by itself, the error does not occur. So it appears that this 
has to do with frames and executing Javascript. Might be a timing-related 
issue.
