When we click on a DDLB (Drop Down List Box), and start typing in some text, the value in the DDLB changes in accordance with the typed in text. Now, if I want to change the last few characters I typed, I have to press Back Space. Only problem is, if I press back space one too many times, it goes to the previous page.

I feel back space pressed in DDLB should behave like backpace pressed in any other input field, and not cause the previous page to be loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a form with a DDLB in it, say a drop down to select a State, enter one or two characters. The value in the DDLB changes as you type
2. Press backspace to change the character you typed... only, type in extra backspaces or hold down the backspace key
3. The previous page is loaded. If you got to the form via a POST request, all the data you filled in till now is lost

Actual Results:  
The previous page is loaded. If you got to the form via a POST request, all the data you filled in till now is lost

Expected Results:  
No Navigation should have been performed on Backspace in DDLB

None
