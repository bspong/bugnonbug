Dialog boxes are not processed when input is given to them but wait for a cleanup thread (or something)

When a dialog box ('Confirm', 'About', etc.) is given input (to an OK button 
for example), the input is not processed until a cleanup thread (or some other 
such process) is given enough priority to destroy it.

This can lead to the browser continuing unwanted behavior until the system gets 
around to giving the thread some resources.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a slow computer (like a P-Pro 233 for instance) bogged down with lots of 
stuff running.
2. Load webpages that requires POST information across several tabs (10 should 
be very sufficient).
3. Click the first tab
4. Refresh the tab
5. Click OK (or press Enter) on the 'Confirm' dialog box.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 5 for each tab.

Actual Results:  
The processing of each 'Confirm' dialog takes longer and longer as system 
resources are given to the refreshing tabs. Eventualy it can take upwards of 10 
to 20 seconds to resolve a confirmation box.

Compounding the problem is the behavior where the Confirm dialog locks input to 
the entire browser until it is resolved and destroyed, making the browser 
completely non-responsive to user input attempts.

Expected Results:  
The confirmation box should have been resolved and destroyed at the time the 
input was given to it.
