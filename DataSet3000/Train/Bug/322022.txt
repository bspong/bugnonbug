1. When importing bookmarks from an HTML bookmark file, the bookmarks toolbar folder is created twice.

2. When trying to move the bookmarks from the imported folder to the existing one so that I can put the bookmarks back on the toolbar, they are redirected to the bookmark root.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. export the bookmarks on one machine or under one user account
2. import them on another machine or different user account
3. try to move the bookmarks from the imported bookmark toolbar folder to the existing one and there you go; they are redirected to the bookmark root.

Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
1. The imported bookmarks that were stored in the bookmark toolbar folder on the original machine (or user account) should have been copied into the existing bookmark toolbar folder on the new machine (or user account)

A nice tweak would be to ask during the import whether the user wants to merge bookmarks (overwriting those of the same name) or replace them (deleting all that exist on the target and replacing them with the imported bookmarks.)

It would be a good idea to allow the user the option of using a documents and settings folder like IE uses rather than an HTML file.  This would make migration of bookmarks something that could be scripted in the background and allow for domain replication.

I have experienced this issue in the past, but what prompted my complaint is the fact that I have had to manually fix this issue on every machine I own under every user account and since I just deployed a domain controller and joined my machines to the same domain, I'm going to have to do it all again.
