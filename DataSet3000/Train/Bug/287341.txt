Livemarks shouldn't load on startup

When you start Firefox, every livemark (or live bookmark) that you have is
redownloaded. If you are on a dial-up connection, and have a lot of livemarks,
then this significantly slows down your surfing for the first few minutes of
browsing. What makes things worse, when in bug 255485 they resolved that
livemarks ignore the cache (with bug 274382 going against that move), is that
everytime you start up Firefox again it reloads every livemark. It basically
kills your connection until they have all downloaded, as well as wasting server
resources.

I have a 56k modem and 29 livemarks. While the problem does go away after about
5 minutes, it still seems unnecessary to load the livemarks at startup. The
end-user may not even access their livemarks during the entire browsing session.
They may only look at some.

Some RSS feeds even ban you after you have downloaded the feed a certain number
of times, for example, Slashdot. Of course I'm downloading it everytime I start
Firefox, and in one day (or one session) I could do it several times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with a lot of Livemarks in your bookmarks and on a modem.
2. Browse the web.
Actual Results:  
The connection is hogged with livemark downloads until they are all initially
downloaded, then browsing resumes at normal modem speeds.

Expected Results:  
Only download the livemarks when a user wants to read them. (i.e. when the user
moves the mouse over the livemark folder).
