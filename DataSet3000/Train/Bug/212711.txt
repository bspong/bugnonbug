Quotes ("", '') in separator name causes Firefox to freeze on restart

Firebird allows you to name seperators (e.g., &lt;HR NAME="Open
Documentation"&gt; )  You're allowed to use quotation marks in the name, which
malforms the markup.  Any new Firebird instances will freeze when trying to load
the bookmark file.  The quotations must be removed with a text editor.  Also,
use of &lt;HR NAME='"Open Documentation"'&gt; or the inverse does not get around
the problem as it should.

This problem doesn't exist with directories or bookmarks because the "title" is
not an HTML attribute in those cases--it's content.  Entities aren't allowed in
the NAME or ID attribute in HTML, and aren't processed in the bookmark file
despite it being invalid HTML.  Striping the quotes will produce an
unexepcted/inconsistent behavior for the user.

Instead of &lt;HR&gt;, using &lt;legend&gt; and/or &lt;fieldset&gt; might be an
alternative.

I think the HTML dictionary-list-bookmark-file cludge is wearing just a wee bit
thin.  It might be about time to either define a solid XML bookmark format,
and/or seperate files for bookmarks (the later of which is unrelated to this bug).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Firebird bookmark manager.
2. Create a seperator
3. Right-click -> Properties, name it something with quotes like "The War" (with
quotes).
4. Close Firebird and relaunch.  Firebird should freeze.
Strangely, Firebird will freeze after the "Make Firebird your default browser"
dialog has been clicked through, not before.

(5.) Recovery: Open your bookmarks.html and find the seperator, delete and/or
remove extra quotation marks from name.

Actual Results:  
Freeze with near 100% CPU usage.

Expected Results:  
not freeze :P  I think it should detect a parse error and attempt to correct the
mark-up.
