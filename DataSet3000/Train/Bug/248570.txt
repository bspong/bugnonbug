This bug appears in Options, but also appears in the Privacy pane, which is
pretty well unusable when in high contrast black colour scheme as the text and 
background are of almost identical colors.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set colour scheme in Control Panel > Display > Appearance to High Contrast Black.
2. Start FireFox
3. Select Tools > Options
4. Move mouse over option tabs or click on Privacy tab

Actual Results:  
Note that text and background are very similar in colour and
difficult for someone to read, especially when they need 
high contrast text!  <grin>

Expected Results:  
Check luminance of graphic background versus text and use background colour of
colour scheme if the luminance is similar.  Perhaps it could compare the
luminance of the graphic with both the foreground and background colour in the
colour scheme and use the one with the greatest difference in luninance.  This
would be a good workaround for any high contrast color shceme.
