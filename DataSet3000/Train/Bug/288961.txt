Firefox 1.0.2 immediate crash while starting

After having upgrading Firefox 1.0 to 1.0.2 everything seemed to be ok. But on
the next day I couldn't start firefox again. Nearly immediatly after having
started Firefox an "exception in blabla: Can't read memory at bla:bla " window
appeared. TCause this cryptic numbers seem to change from try to try
arbitrarily, I assume that they are not really of importance. 
I uninstalled version 1.02 and reinstalled version 1.0. Everything was fine
again and then I updated to version 1.0.2 and again, first it seemed to be ok,
but suddenly (opened a link from inside a Lotus Notes Email) I again got this
error message. And from this moment on the browser becomes unusable.  Have
repeated this process another time and the same problem appeared after some time
(Same afternoon) 
 
Uninstalled the browser and reinstalled version 1.0 and now I'm using version
1.0 since 2 hours without problem and will use it until this problem has been
solved or you should ask for further info to reproduce this error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Version 1.0
2. Update to Version 1.02
3. Use/Call the browser n-times, n+1 will be a crash ( Guess, n was in average
less than 10 times)

Actual Results:  
Browser crashed immediatly. No other window than the exception window was openend.

Expected Results:  
Should have started.

I'm using firefox since version 0.8 and never had this problem before. It seems
to be bound to Version 1.02. I always use the standard theme.

As I can live with Version 1.0 I see the severity as normal.
