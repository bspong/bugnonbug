Upgraded Firefox RC2 doesn't update the statusbar text on user 
interactions but only for internal actions such as; hover over 
a link or stop page loading where text remains same, unchanged. 
But during site loading etc., statusbar text updates itself 
showing actions like; waiting / transferring / ...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open your preferred site with links
2.Move your mouse over a link of your choice
&
1.Open a site
2.Stop operation while waiting / transfering / ...
3.Switch tabs
Actual Results:  
Link's URL does not show in the statusbar field
&
Statusbar doesn't update, just shows last 
operation 'Stopped' although you switched tabs

Expected Results:  
Link's URL should have been displayed in the 
statusbar as it is used to be in RC1 & PR
&
Statusbar text should be updated on switching 
tabs to a text related to the switched tab.

Since I do first install Firefox RC1 + extensions, 
then upgrade it to RC2, the problem can be due to 
these. I'll appreciate if anyone with RC2 can 
confirm or deny this so that I know where to look.
