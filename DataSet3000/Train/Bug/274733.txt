I am using Movable Type 2.661 to run a blog.  If I copy formatted text from
another webpage into a New Entry form (e.g. into the Entry Body part of the
form), it pastes as expected, but if I then copy or cut a portion of the text
(e.g. a few paragraphs) and then paste the text into a different part of the New
Entry form (e.g. Extended Entry) or even into a text editor then the line feeds
and returns are lost -- essentially I can't use Firefox to make entries in my
blog because I lose paragraph formatting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a web page with paragraphs of text
2. select multiple paragraphs
3. open another webpage with boxes to paste text into (such as the Firefox bug
entry form)

Actual Results:  
the formatting of the paragraphs is lost and all the text runs together

Expected Results:  
keep the formatting between paragraphs (line feeds and such)
