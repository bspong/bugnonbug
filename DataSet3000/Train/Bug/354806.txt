Invisible bookmarks folder, tabs inoperative, issues with RC1 upgrade

I've had no problems at work but at home I'm having a few problems with RC1. First off being that when i go to log into bugzilla there's no response when I enter my login details. The next problem is that I have a space for the bookmarks toolbar, and the bookmarks appear in the bookmarks toolbar on the bookmarks menu, but nothing is appearing on the bookmarks toolbar itself. The last problem is that I can't use multiple tabs. When i go to open a new one and select it, the address bar does not synchronise. Even though the tab is in the foreground, when I enter something in the address bar, it just overwrites the first pane rather than the one I'm working with.

My add ons are: chatzilla 0.9.75 google toolbar for firefox 2.1.20060807W Html validator 1.2.2 (htmlvalidator.com) Talkback 2.0 (which reports it isn't compatible with Firefox 1.5.0.7 even though the Browser about says Firefox 2.0) Web developer 1.0.2

Uninstalling RC1 and going back to 1.5.0.7, everything reverted to normal

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Installed Firefox 2 RC1
2.
3.
