You can't restore bookmarks by copying bookmarks.html from a old profile into a
new one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close all FF instances
2. go to profile
3. delete bookmarks.bak
4. open Firefox
5. open bookmarks, all bookmarks are replaced by the default bookmarks



Expected Results:  
FF builds a new bookmarks.bak out of the current bookmarks.html.

Tested with Linux (Ubuntu 5.04, firefox-1.0+.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz)

This regressed between 2005080805 and 2005080905, so i suppose it's a regression
by Bug 298943 (if bookmarks.html is missing , bookmark.bak is not copied to
bookmarks.html).

To restore bookmarks you must copy over bookmarks.html and bookmarks.bak.


I think this problem is related to the bug described above:
1. close all FF instances
2. go to profile
3. replace bookmarks.html by a new bookmarks.html (different content)
4. open Firefox
5. open bookmarks, bookmarks are restored out of the bookmarks in bookmarks.bak 
(expected: new bookmarks.bak out of the current bookmarks.html after closing)
6. sometimes the bookmarkfile (out of bookmarks.bak) is corrupted:
-bookmarks with umlauts are changed
before: ID="rdf:#$kFkEX3">TESTTEST-öööüüüäää-TESTTEST</A>
after: ID="rdf:#$kFkEX3">TESTTEST-Ã¶Ã¶Ã¶Ã¼Ã¼Ã¼Ã¤Ã¤Ã¤-TESTTEST</A>
-bookmarks are missing
