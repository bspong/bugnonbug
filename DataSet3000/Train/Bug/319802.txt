browser will not launch
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: 

Was browsing Southwest Airlines when browser crashed.  It would not relaunch. I took the following steps: 1) rebooted my computer; 2) reloaded Firefox from my saved setup file; 3) used system restore to take my computer back ten days; 4) used add/remove to remove Firefox from my computer; 5) used IE to go to Mozilla and download Firefox.  The problem remains; when I launch the browser, it appears to launch and a Mozilla Central screen briefly (less than a second) appears and then disappears.  The problem appears to be exactly what is described in the Yahoo news article by Montalbano on Friday, December 9th.
All other programs on the computer work.  IE, Netscape and Netzero all launch, and run without problem.  The only thing I haven't yet done is to launch Firefox on another computer.
Obviously, I can use another browser and work unimpeded.  But I like Firefox; in fact, I love it.

After some tedious digressions, I hooked up to Earthlink via a dial-up connection on my laptop, and on that machine with that connection I had no trouble launching Mozilla.
