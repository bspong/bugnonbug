This happens especially when I actually go to an ad.  If you drop the provided
link into Firefox, the pictures will not show.  I always IE when visiting ebay
becuase this problem is so bad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Drop "http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=5574554392" into
address window and hit enter.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Frames and hyperlinks are active, but no pictures.

Expected Results:  
Show the pictures

This also happens at amazon.com.  When placing an order, the java/VB buttons do
not show up.  But if you wave your mouse over the exact area where the button
should be, the mouse cursor changes to indicate a clickable link.  You can then
click on it.

I was reading around, and I'm finding that not all websites are writing
according to w3c standards.  They should but they are not.  In the meantime, and
in order to complete the Firefox coup against Microshaft, compatibility with
current non-w3c websites should be coded into Firefox and dropped when Firefox
is more widely recognized.  That's why I checked "major" in the problem severity
section.
