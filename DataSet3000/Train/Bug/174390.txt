Bookmarks Toolbar overflow doesn't account for toolbar items to the right of the BT; overflow only cares about the browser border.

If there are toolbar item(s) to the right of the Bookmarks Toolbar Items, and
the browser window is too narrow, the toolbar items(s) are shoved past the
righthand browser window border.  If the chevron appears, it only shows the
hidden bookmarks toolbar items.  The extra 'normal' toolbar items are not shown.

The bookmarks toolbar overflow should treat other toolbar items that are to the
right of the BT and are against the browser border as if the toolbar items were
the browser border and use the chevron rather than shoving the toolbar items off
view. (good luck parsing that sentence...)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Shrink browser window horizontally (this makes it easier to see the problem
if you have few BT items)
2. Customize Toolbars...
3. Place a toolbar item to the right of the 'BT Items' (eg the Throbber).
4. Put enough items to the left of the BT Items to overflow the BT.
5. Exit customize toolbars
6. Refresh screen to show the chevron (bug 173493)

Actual Results:  
The item(s) placed to the right of the BT Items in step 3 aren't visable.


Expected Results:  
The item(s) placed to the right of the BT ITems in step 3 should be visable and
bounded by the righthand browser border; the BT should make the chevron appear
to the left of those items.
