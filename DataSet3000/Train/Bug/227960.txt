drop-down listbox in Add Bookmark does not expand nor get focus, remaining locked on a previously used subfolder

When I try to add a bookmark (by pressing Ctrl-D or choosing Add Bookmark from
my Bookmarks menu) in my currently used profile, the "Create In" drop-down
remains locked on a subfolder I last added a bookmark to. I cannot get the
drop-down to expand neither by clicking on its button, neither by pressing the
down arrow. If I try to cycle the focus with Tab, it cycles through all elements
of the window but when it is supposed to be on the "Create In" dropdown the item
is not correctly highlighted and cannot be accessed.
The problem is persistent (closing all browser instances and starting a new one
yields the same behaviour).
Unfortunately I am unable to reproduce the problem if I create a new profile - I
could send you my bookmarks if necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any webpage
2.Press Ctrl-D
3.Try to pick a different folder from the currently highlighted one.

Actual Results:  
It stays locked on the folder which was displayed when the window appeared

Expected Results:  
It should have presented me with the folder tree
