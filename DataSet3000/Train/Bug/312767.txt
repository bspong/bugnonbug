2 bugs in one it seems:
In the latest version:
go to www.runlondon.com, select watch your finish. use runners name (eg my
friend Debamoy Chatterjee). then try to watch video.  it's meant to only show
the portion of the video pertinent to that runner. that's what happens in
explorer. In firefox, it seems to play the video from the Very beginning...
In 1.5Beta:
no video shows at all! When I press F5 to refresh the page, Firefox crashes
completely!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.runlondon.com
2.select "watch my finish"
3.enter runner name (eg Debamoy Chattejee)
4. search for video.. 
5. on video page either the incorrect portion is shown (proper release), or NO
video is shown and then FIREFX CRASHES on pressing F5....

Actual Results:  
on full release:  incorrect video shown

on beta release: no video and COMPLETE CRASH on refresh

Expected Results:  
shown portion of video pertinent to runner (works in explorer)

Page causes CRASH in BETA
