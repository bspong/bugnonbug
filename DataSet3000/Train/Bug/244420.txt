The problem appears to be related to extensions but I am filing it against
firefox because the two different systems I tested it on have no overlap
in the extensions used.

It is VERY common for criminally incompetent webmasters to write something like
    <A HREF="javascript:showDoc('http://....');">
Which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, instead of:
    <A HREF="http://....">

Now, if I disable all extensions, disable popup blocking, and fully enable
javascript, this works on both browser configurations.

But If I enable extensions, it fails silently.   Thing is, it isn't the same
extensions on the two browsers.   It is the window.open() call which is 
failing; the alert() dialog boxes I have added prove that javascript is being
run.   However, when the window.open() call fails, the following javascript
does not get executed.

I tried, unsuccessfully, to determine which extension on the linux side was
responsible by selectively enabling and disabling extensions.  Instead, I
mannaged to end up with a user profile that wouldn't let firefox start up.
Also, it is very difficult to restore the browser to its prior state
after having to create a new profile.

None of the extensions involved are pop-up blockers.

Also, this problem seems to infect the 
   Firefox -> Tools-> Options -> Extensions -> get newbutton as well.

Even if the two extensions are making the same coding error, this still points
to some problems in firefox.   There are no features to allow debugging of
extensions.  Where is the tool that would show me which methods are invoked
when I press a button and which extensions or built in functions are executed
as a result?   Short of riding the full mozilla/firefox developer learning
curve, there doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to diagnose extension problems.
When I tried the venkman debugger (on windows), the problem disappeared
after I selected Debug ->  Error Trigger -> Trace errors, even when I
subsequently set it back to "Ignore errors".   So, it may be that the
debugger changes the error handling behavior of firefox once you first
select this.  However, if you select "stop on error" mode, it doesn't
stop for the error below though it does intermittently stop in various other
places that aren't related to the problem being reported, as those bugs are
excited by activity.

The following error appears at approximately the time the program would
malfunction as outlined in this report:
Error: ``this.docShell has no properties`` [xs] in file
``chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml``, line 0, character 0.



Other Problems I noticed while trying to debug this one:
 - If a javascript <script> section has a parsing error, all functions in that
   section cease to function, even those which occur before the syntax error.
   For example, omiting a closing quote or closing parenthisis on a function
   call at the bottom of this section renders the whole section unusable.
   It is likely that this will make for even more pages that run on
   other browsers but not firebird.
   However, no error is reported on the javscript console.
 - Javascript console:
    - Does not display syntax errors when loading file
    - Many javascript commands silently fail with no error
    - Needs options to
        [ ] Evaluate command with remote privileges
        [ ] Evaluate command with local privileges
        [ ] Evaluate command within context of current page.  I.E. window,
            document, and other objects set appropriately 
        [ ] Evaluate command in separate context




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Create a new user profile with no extensions initially loaded.
   (kinda hard to do if you installed your extensions system wide)
   or disable all extensions.
1. Load either tab browser extension or longer list of extensions above.
2. Copy html/javascript snippet below to file and open in browser
3. click on the "click here" link.
4. Wait for Godot   (literary reference)
5. Disable all extensions
6. Try again


Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.   No error messages in javascript console.

Expected Results:  
Open document in new tab.

	function bzzt(text)    {
	   alert('bzzt: '+text);
	}
        bzzt('test');
        function showDoc(dest_link) {
          alert('Got Here!');
          // this works:
          //window.location=dest_link;
          // this doesn't
          window.open(dest_link, 'foo777', '');        // <------BUG!!!
