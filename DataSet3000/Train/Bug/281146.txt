History remains empty, back/foward buttons remain empty.  Location bar does not accept an "enter" ! (UI really not working)

I would have put this under a UI component rather than History, but a large portion of the problem 
seems to have to do with data never being filled in the right places (History, and the Back/Forward 
buttons).

The only page I can go to is the Home page, or whatever is input via prefs for the home page.  If I type 
any URL into the location bar, and hit enter, it does not respond.

After going to the home page and clicking through several links, the back and forward buttons remain 
grayed out (nothing has populated the back button) and the history remains empty as if I'd not clicked 
through those links.

So, this is a major bug that makes the 1.0 and later unusable.  I had used some pre 1.0 versions and 
seem to remember that they did not have this problem.  Currently running system 10.3.7

or.
