(maybe this relates only to web pages with flash)

I have some bookmark menus on the 'Personal Toolbar' that are folders with many
bookmarks in them.

If I view the above URL, then click on one of the bookmark folders, I notice
that a sound is played as I move the pointer up and down the bookmarks. This
only happens when the pointer is over part of the web page that would make this
noise, ie when it is over the small 'window' just below the login 'window' on
the top left hand side of the web page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.make a bookmark folder on your personal toolbar that has a large number of
bookmarks in it, such that, when you open the folder, the selection menu drops
down over a large portion of the web page.
2.view the above web page in the browser
3.notice that, as you move the pointer over the text "profile", "Pucca's Room",
and "News", a "Pucca Icon" appears, and a sound plays.
4.if you now open the bookmark folder that you have carefully positioned to drop
down over that window, the same things happen as if there was no bookmark menu
was there.

Actual Results:  
things happen on the web page depending on the position of the pointer, when the
bookmark menu is selected

Expected Results:  
nothing should happen on the web page when selecting a bookmark
