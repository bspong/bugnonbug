On the webpage http://www.sportsnet.ca below the Sportsnet logo should be a
scrolling news bar, which should be displaying three headlines which should go
from right to left. It requires Java Runtime Enviornment to be siplayed and
whenever I try to install Java Runtime Enviornment on this page it instal the
missing plugin (Java Runtime error) but then when installing the window
installer says the installation package cannot be found and the webpage reloads
without the scrolling headline bar. And each time I try to istall the Java
Runtime Enviornment plugin it does it.

3.Wait and after it istals the missing plugin the windows installer cannot find
the instalation package

instalation package and the page reloaded inself without the scrolling headline bar.

bar should have shown the three main headlines and scrolled from right to left
on the page.
