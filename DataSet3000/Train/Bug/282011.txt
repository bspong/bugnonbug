Some preferences reset after installing an update or extension.

When I install an Extension, update one, or simply update firefox to the latest
version, a lot of settings get reverted back to their original values. The most
obvious and annoying one is that the download location is reset to "Always to
this location..." which has been set to desktop. Also, the message boxes like
"You are sending this information through an unencrypted page, are you sure?"
start coming up again as if all the "Don't ask me again" values in the settings
were reverted back to false.
This has occured on both of my computers.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a new extension (I used FlashGot for first result, then Linky)
2. Restart the browser.
3. Bug sometimes occurs now.
4. Update the extension to latest version.
5. Restart the browser.
6. Bug sometimes occurs now.

As I stated above, you can also get the same thing happening when you update
Firefox. It's happened twice to me, once ages ago and again when I updated to v1.0
Actual Results:  
Nothing changed the first time, but the message box occured the second time when
I went to enter a query into Google. All the settings have been reset.

Expected Results:  
Updated the software/extension without losing the settings.

Second PC:
Processor: AMD ATHLON 1200 (912MHz)
Motherboard: JETWAY 663AS
Graphics: ATI RADEON 7500 (Current Resolution: 1024x768x32)
Sound: None

Bug happened on both computers. They both have a wireless 52MBps LAN card in
them, which connects to my router.

I think the bug can be resolved or worked around by backing up the settings
before the update and restoring them after the update.
