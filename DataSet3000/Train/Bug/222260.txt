Page that sets cookie is called twice
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

In a PHP hit logging script, that uses a 15 minute long cookie to determine a
new hit or a subsequent hit, The logs show that Mozilla 0.6 and 0.7 hit the page
twice everytime, with a second or so between them.

The script tests for a cookie by name, and records to a Db accordingly. 

So on first entry (no cookie set), a hit is logged and  the cookie is set,
causing another hit to be logged for this page access. 

Moving to a different page logs a hit, the timeout for the cookie is reset by
this page which in turn causes another hit to be logged. 

Thus always double logging with Moz 0.6/0.7, this does not happen with IE6,Opera
7, or Netscape 7.0 on Win2k or Win98.

To ensure it was double hitting, I checked my Apache access log, here's a
typical Mozilla 0.6/0.7 page hit (index.php called twice):
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:07 +0100] "GET /index.php...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:07 +0100] "GET /css/menuimg/20.gif...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:08 +0100] "GET /someinclude.php...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:08 +0100] "GET /index.php...

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.simple PHP script to check for a named cookie. If set, refresh the time, if
not set, set it.
2. check time of access against server access log, look for double page call.
3. Repeat with other browsers, esp. Netscape 7.0, and note this does not happen.

Actual Results:  
server log for Moz. shows second page call as above
server log for same page with Netscape 7.0, shows page (index.php) is called
only once.

Expected Results:  
Should not recall page when a cookie is set/refreshed.

Noticed on Mozilla 0.6, downloaded Mozilla 0.7 with default theme, no
improvement.  Sample scripts have been tested many times, cookies deleted and
tests carried out again each time.
Has been tested on Win98 and Win2k only.
Cannot replicate this issue in any other browsers.
