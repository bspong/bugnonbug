Opens all of my start pages every time I press "Start page"-button. Annoying!

I use 5 different start pages, in 5 differens tabs. When I first found this
function I exploaded in happiness, but when I discovered that the browser opens
_all of my start pages_ every time I press "Startpage" I unchecked the function.

I think many people agree with me about this. I want FireFox to open just my
"first startpage" when i press the startpage button, and only open all pages
when i start the browser.

For example: Every time I want to do a NEW search on Google, I press the
startpage button. Then I just want the specific tab to go to Google, i don't
want 5 new tabs. So, can't you do a function like this: "Only open
multi-startpages when Firefox starts"

I'm sorry for my bad english.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose multiple startpages.
2. Open Firefox, now you should have more than one tab open (if you added more).
We can pretend that you have four tabs/startpages open now.

3. Press the "Startpage-button", now you have eight(!) tabs instead of four.
And you only wanted to go to Google to do a search.

Actual Results:  
I now have eight tabs.

Expected Results:  
Just made the active tab go to my "first startpage". (The first tab you had in
the list when you choosed startpages.)
