blank entries in satchel drop-down
OK, this may be hard to follow (especially because I'm super excited to have
found a 100% reproducible technique for this long-standing bug), but I'll try my
best.

Symptoms: satchel drop-down selection list SHOULD should N entries, and has
enough room for N entries, but the spot where the Nth should be is blank.

Reproducing: build a form memory with the following entries:
  foo
  foo blah
  foo testing
  foo reproduce

Now reload the page.

1) Type 'f'. See all four entries.
2) Type 'oo'. "foo" disappears. (see bug 217640 which I recently filed)
3) Type space. All three entries still shown, as expected.
NOTE: at this point, backspacing back to "fo" would behave properly. The four
      entries would be shown.
4) Now type a character that doesn't match anything. 'x'.
5) All matches disappear. This is correct.
6) Backspace. The three entries reappear. This is correct.
7) Backspace twice more, to "foo", then to "fo". Now you SHOULD again
have four entries. And there is space for four. But only three are shown. If you
arrow down to the fourth, the text field changes to it properly, so perhaps
there's some off-by-one in the code that shows matches, but not in the code
which selects an entry for the text field.

I believe there may be other circumstances which cause this pseudo-blank satchel
entry, but I'm hoping these instructions for reproduction can help track down
the root cause.

I think with a little more tweaking, satchel can become a usability win for FB
over IE. I'm eager to see these seemingly minor problems eliminated.
