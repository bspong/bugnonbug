option marked as selected does not get selected in drop down when selected="value"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Whenever a dropdown is coded as :

<select name="testselect">
<option value="1">First option</option>
<option value="2">Second option</option>
<option value="3">Third option</option>
<option selected="selected" value="4">Fourth option</option>
</select>

The fourth option does not appear as selected in the webpage.  Instead the first
option appears as selected.

The selected="selected" (or some other value instead of the word selected for
the attribute's value) causes the problem.

From searching the web I have found that FireFox 0.8 worked correctly (although
I have not confirmed this).  It does not work in 0.9

Firefox needs to be able to accept an value for this attribute - even though it
is not standard HTML) because several of dynamic languages automatically code
this into the page (one example: ASP.NET)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a select box and mark an option other than the first option with the
attribute selected="somevalue"
2. Open the web page
3. The first option will be selected regardless of which option has this
selected attribute present

Actual Results:  
First option was selected

Expected Results:  
indicated option should have been selected
