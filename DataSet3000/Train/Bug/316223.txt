When I attempt to import my exported bookmarks Firefox crashes (not responding and then crash)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark over 550 differnet links and sort them, with the help of maps and seperators, and then export them in "manage bookmarks"
2. Import them in "manage bookmarks"


Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes (not responding and then crash). A few times my computer crashed too and I had to reboot. 

Expected Results:  
I expect to be able to import my exported bookmarks without any problems despite the amount of bookmarked links, 10 or 1000. 

I think the problem is related to the amount of links the exported HTML-file include, that is beeing imported. I have tried to import other bookmarks that I have exported, with only a few maps, seperators and actual links and that worked fine. Today was the first time I had a problem with this, the cause is that I was arranging and sorting all my saved links (saved in txt files etcetera).
