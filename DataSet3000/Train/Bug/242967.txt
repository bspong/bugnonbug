mail button is malformed

the structure of the mail button is needlessly complex.  it contains two nested
boxes, when none are needed, and also contains orientation attributes that break
themes. the patch for bug 237959 was completely unecessary, and actually didn't
fix the problem - it just changed the problem.  button orientation is handled by
the theme.  using the standard menu-type toolbarbutton will greatly simplify
things and fix these problems.

at first, looking thru browser.xul, it's unclear where these extra boxes come
from.  but with a little digging, it would appear the mail-button uses the
"menu-orient" binding instead of the standard "menu".

current structure:
toolbarbutton orient="vertical"
  hbox
    box
      image/
      label/
    /box
    dropmarker/
  /hbox
/toolbarbutton

proposed structure:
toolbarbutton
  image/
  label/
  dropmarker/
/toolbarbutton

unless there's some yet-to-be-used functionality planned for the mail button
which necessitates this structure, it should be changed to the regular "menu" type.

precedent exists in the DOM Inspector panel buttons, the Web Developer
extension's toolbar buttons, and even the regular old toolbar bookmark folders.
