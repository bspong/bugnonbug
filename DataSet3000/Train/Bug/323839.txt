Toolbar overflow causes parts of webpage to bounce and the UI to extend beyond the edge of the screen

When I use the GoogleBar with the search term highlighting turned on, it prints each word of the search query as a button on the toolbar. As these buttons extend beyond the edge of the viewable screen, the UI extends in an attempt to fit the extended length. However, when the window is maximized, this causes the scrollbar to move past the edge of the viewable screen. It also causes problems with divs that have relative placement. They start to bounce between their normal position and the position they would be if the screen were wide enough to hold the entire UI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using a toolbar extension, cause the items on the toolbar to overflow
2. Observe how the UI extends past the end of the viewable screen.
3. Watch certain divs begin to "bounce".

Actual Results:  
Bad Webpage and UI rendering

Expected Results:  
Toolbar buttons cut off gracefully, The UI doesn't extend past the edge of the viewable screen, and relatively placed divs don't bounce.
