When you go to customize toolbars and have your bookmarks toolbar filled with
items overflowing (showing the overflow arrows), and you click done on the
customization screen, you loose the overflow arrows and wind up with one of your
bookmarks half off the screen.  After, if you minimize the screen and then
Maximize it the overflow arrows come back and the bookmarks toolbar is fine
(takes a second or two), or you can also add another bookmark to get them to
come back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the Bookmarks toolbar filled to where the overflow arrows appear
2. Open the toolbar customization screen.
3. Click 'Done' (You don't have to actually customize anything)
4. Notice the Bookmarks Toolbar overflow arrows are gone

Actual Results:  
After customization, Bookmarks toolbar overflow arrows disappear.  Have to
minimize/mazimize screen or add another toolbar to get them back.

Expected Results:  
The overflow arrows should re-appear once the customize dialog is dismissed.
