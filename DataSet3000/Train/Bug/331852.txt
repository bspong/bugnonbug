'Confirm close' dialog should offer third button/option 'Close active tab only'  RFE

When I close the FF window, having multiple tabs open, the 'Confirm close' dialog offers the two buttons/options 1. 'Close tabs' and 2. 'Cancel' 

(message says: "You are about to close x open tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?"  'Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tabs' is enabled)

RFE: A third button/option 'Close active tab only' (or similar) would enhance usability
- I am accustomed to close windows by clicking the windows close button; therfore I use this function sometimes erroneously instead of the close tab button (given that my intend is to close the active tab only instead of the whole FF window). The requested feature will allow to recover from this user error more effective  (only one click on the new suggested button instead of two clicks - 'cancel' and 'close tab')

This is a DWIM instead of a DWIS feature - 'Do What I Mean' instead of 'Do What I Say'  ;-)   It will alleviate user errors
