Uncloseable Sidebar - Showing up automatically
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8

I've Firebird 0.7 version running GREAT.

I installed Firefox 0.8 from Windows Installer
into a different directory on my Windows XP Pro.

After installing, when I run the Firefox 0.8,
it comes up with an EMPTY Sidebar. I tried
to close the Sidebar by clicking on the "X"
button at the top, but it would NOT close.

So, I go under "View" Menu to display some
sidebar. And then I try closing the sidebar.
ONLY after doing that, the sidebar disappears.

HOWEVER,
when I close & restart the Firefox 0.8 again, the sidebar
is showing up automatically again, and wouldn't 
close as I described as above.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 0.8 on Windows XP Professional (at least for me)
2. Click on "X" button for the EMPTY Sidebar
3. The Sidebar would NOT close
4. Go to "View" menu to activate any available sidebar.
5. Then, try closing the Sidebar --> it closes successfully
6. Close & restart the Firefox 0.8 again
Actual Results:  
After, Step 3--> The EMPTY sidebar would NOT close

After, Step 6--> The EMPTY sidebar shows up automatically again

Expected Results:  
For Step 3
The sidebar should be closed when "X" button is clicked


For Step 6
The sidebar should NOT show up when the browser
is restarted since I closed it before I shutdown
the browser
