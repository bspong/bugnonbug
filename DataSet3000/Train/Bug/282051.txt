Dual Monitors; DivX AVI video at
<http://web.phys.cmu.edu/~tiziana/BHGrow/movie_hq.avi>
title screen is displayed on wrong monitor and the video
controls are missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser window on second monitor
2. go to <http://web.phys.cmu.edu/~tiziana/BHGrow/>
3. click on link "Movie: Highest quality (22 MB, 1024x768)"

Actual Results:  
The title screen is displayed in the browser window
on the second monitor and also at the same relative
position as the upper let corner o the browser window
on the main monitor (not the same position as the 
video in the browser window).

The video controls are off screen and the browser window 
has no scroll bar.



Expected Results:  
The video should have been displayed only in the browser window

the video was a DivX 4.2 AVI video file

This bug is similar to a bug I reported in FireFox 0.8
but in 0.8 the video controls were displayed.
