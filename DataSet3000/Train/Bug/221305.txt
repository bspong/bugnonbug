backwards navigation records too many steps when working with frames

www.govhs.org -> Unfortunately, the problem I am experiencing is in a private
webpage for people enrolled in the classes. But the problem is this: The format
is of a left-side frame, a bottom navigation-bar frame, a top multipurpose space
for buttons, a top-left frame, and a bottom-left frame. Whenever many of the
links are clicked, the other frames reload too so that their functions match the
page being viewed. With Internet Explorer, the back button will send the browser
back to the state it was in before the link was clicked (and I think this is
key), whereas it seems Firebird logs all actions it takes (whether
server-directed or not). I hope you can understand what I'm trying to get at; I
don't have the technological vocabulary to explain it any more specifically, but
I hope this will help you to identify and squash the bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the site
2. Enter a class
3. Click a document link (preferably in the message board)
4. Try to go back with the back button... only one small thing will actually
change and several back-steps are required when only one forward step was taken.
Actual Results:  
It took several clicks of the 'Back' button to return to where I was before I
clicked the last link.

Expected Results:  
It should have only required one click to return me to my original location.
