In textfields on a HTML page, the "End" key works like the "Home" key, i.e. it
moves the cursor to the start of the line, not to the end. The "Home" key also
works like the "Home" key.
In addition, clicking the mouse on the textfield to the right of the entered
text also moves the cursor to the start of the line, not to the end.
This usually only happens on one-line textfields, but it's happening right now
in the "Steps to Reproduce" text area.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an HTML page containing textfield.
2. Type some text in the textfield.
3. Press the "End" key.


Actual Results:  
The cursor moves to the start of the line.


Expected Results:  
The cursor should move to the end of the line.


This sometimes happens, sometimes doesn't. I can fathom no logic to what is
causing it to appear or disappear. It's not a bug in my keyboard or my operating
system, as textfields in every other program work normally.
