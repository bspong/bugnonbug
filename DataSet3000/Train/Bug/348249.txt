When using "Show page source" or "Show page information" on sites using frames it's very awkward to find the frame related "Show page source" and "Show page information" menu items hidden within a sub menu.

Comparing the frequency on how often "Show page source" or "Show page information" are used on inner and outer frames, respectively (99.9% : 0.1%), it would be much more efficient to have the "Current Frame" submenu replaced with an "Outer Frame" (or "Window") submenu and to swap functionality of the corresponding menu items accordingly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Frames based webpage
2. Right click into any of the frames
Actual Results:  
Selecting context menu item "Show page source" shows the source of the outermost frame (or "top" window object), whereas opening the "Current Frame" submenu and then selecting the context menu item "Show page source" shows the source of the currently active frame (or "self" window object).

Expected Results:  
Selecting context menu item "Show page source" should show the source of the currently active frame (or "self" window object), whereas opening the "Outer Frame" submenu and then selecting the context menu item "Show page source" should show the source of the outermost frame (or "top" window object).

Possible solution: Just rename the sub menu and exchange event handlers, both in the context menu and the main menu as well.
