This error message can be found when viewing any HTML or XUL page in a firefox browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a simple page in firefox, such as <BODY>Hi</BODY>
2. Open accExplorer (from MSAA SDK) and use 'Choose From List' to select the Firefox window
3. Expand the child whose role text is 'application' and whose name matches the browser window title bar text.
4. Expand the NAMELESS whose role text is 'pane'
5. Expand its child, whose role text is 'property page'

Actual Results:  
The child of the node with role text of 'property page' has an accessible name matching the page title, but the Role text states "Error: unexpected VARIANT"

Expected Results:  
Provide role text matching the role of the node.  Potentially 'window'?

There is a possibility that this accessible role text error is impacting JAWS behavior of XUL pages loaded in the browser.  This error message was discovered when viewing a XUL page whose top-level element was a tabbox.  The text of the tabs of the tabbox are not read by jaws when the page is loaded via a chrome: URL, even though that text is exposed by MSAA as verified by the inspect32 tool.  The text was read correctly when the same XUL page was loaded in xulrunner.  This error message was not found in the xulrunner tree.
