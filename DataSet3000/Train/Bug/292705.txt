After clicking "Edit Options" in a notice bar, the Preferences window reopens after pressing OK

I just installed the Wikipedia extension mentioned in Bug #292635. This showed a
new bug.
If you have forbidden web sites from installing software, trying to install
Mozilla extensions shows a notice bar at the top of the page:
"Software installation is currently turned off. Choose Edit Options to specify."
followed by a button saying "Edit Options".
Now when I click on this button, I get the Mozilla Firefox Preferences window. I
then allow web sites to install software, and press OK. The Preferences window
closes, but instantly reopens, at a slightly different place. Pressing OK again
usually gets rid of it, but sometimes it reopens two or three times.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Forbid software installation.
2. Try to install a Mozilla extension.
3. Press "Edit Options".
4. Allow software installation in the resulting window.
5. Press "OK".

Actual Results:  
The Preferences window closed and instantly reopened.

Expected Results:  
The Preferences window should have stayed closed.
