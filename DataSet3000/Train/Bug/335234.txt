clientWidth reports invalid page width when running some visual plugins like firebug

When having e.g. Firebug open the minimum reported client width in the HTML-page becomes circa 400 pixels, even when the window actually is smaller.

This results in problems giving elements a proper width for smaller window sizes when running plugins which causes this effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install e.g. Firebug and open its panel.
2. Load the described HTML-file and check the reported client width which updates for each resize.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
	<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
	<title>Insert title here</title>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		function reportSize()
		{
			var e = document.getElementById( "b" );
			e.innerHTML = e.clientWidth;
			document.title = e.clientWidth;
		}
	</script>
	</head>
	<body onresize="reportSize()">
		<div id="b" style="border: 1px dotted black;"></div>
	</body>
</html>

Actual Results:  
When the window width becomes too small the client width is stuck in a larger value. Also, the right edge of the div in the given example is not visible any more.

Expected Results:  
The javascript code should have received a width smaller than the reported when the browser window is as narrow as it can get.

The phenomenon also appears when having many plugins with icons populating the status bar in the lower part of the window. For example, I am running "IE-Tab", "Siteadvisor", "Firebug" and "Foxpose" and when not having the Firebug open the minimum client width becomes smaller than previously, but it cannot be as small as it should when the window is as narrow as it can get.
