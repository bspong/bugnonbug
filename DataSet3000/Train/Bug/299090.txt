Crash if addSearchEngine called with invalid search plugin file but valid search icon (mycroft search engine) [@ nsCharTraits::length]

It is possible to fool firefox into adding a search engine that does not exist
if you specify a valid icon for that search engine in the call to
addSearchEngine(). Selecting this search engine will then crash Firefox.

Confusingly, it will not do this the next time you try it, because it will not
add the search engine if an icon file with the specified name already exists,
and it already downloaded it into the searchplugins folder.

Crucially it does not seem to check for the existence of the src file for the
plugin before adding it to the list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Make a call to window.sidebar.addSearchEngine() within the following restrictions:
1. The search plugin icon must be a valid file
2. The search plugin icon file must not already be downloaded (either because
it's used by an existing plugin, or because you've tried this before)
3. The search plugin source file must *not* be a valid file (or not accessible)

Then,
4. Select the search entry (which will have an icon but no text) in the search
engine dropdown.
Actual Results:  
Firefox downloaded the icon but not the source file (which didn't exist) without
complaint. It added an item to the end of the list of search engines with the
icon specified, but no text. When this item was selected, Firefox crashed.

Expected Results:  
If the file was not found, the icon and entry in the list should not have been
added (this is what Mozilla does). Some sort of error message would have been
nice, too. :-)
