Status bar icons should have explanatory first time message

The status bar icons should have a tutorial "first-time" message so user will
know why they appeared. The pop-up blocker already does this. Security lock kind
of does. RSS and style-switcher need them too.

Ideally, the icons should have extra attention brought to them the first time
they appear, maybe by flashing, showing and arrow, etc. The message could be in
either a dialog or in an info bar.

RSS should say something like:
This web site offers its content as a feed. Feeds can be added to your bookmarks
as a live bookmark using the icon in the status bar. [RSS icon]
_Read more about Live Bookmarks_ [link to appropriate section in help].

Style Switcher:
This web site is available in more than one visual style. The style may be
changed by using this icon in the status bar. [AltSS icon]
_Read more about Style Switching_ [link to appropriate section in help].

All these dialogs should have a "[ ] Show this message every time" that defaults
unchecked.

The security lock icon should be incorporated into the
security.warn_entering_secure dialog so that the correlation between the icon
and security is made. The dialog should also be edited to mention that the
site's domain is shown next to the lock.

I somehow doubt it's possible to get all these strings in before PR, but I think
this would be a win for newbies/novices.
