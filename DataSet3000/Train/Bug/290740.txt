Unwanted conversion of urls when pasting html text (absolute->relative)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I am running into this bug or misfeature. When pasting html text within Firefox
into some web site html editor window, all absolute urls refering to that site
get automatically converted into relative urls. As an example if I send mail
from gmail.google.com, an absolute link
href="http://gmail.google.com/test/test"
gets converted into
href="../test/test"

While this is an artificial example, at the web site I am running, users
frequently paste links refering to other pages on the site in a discussion forum
like this one. The forum postings are also emailed to the participants . The
resulting email messages thus contain dysfunctional links. Worse yet our email
server has been configured to scan both outgoing and incoming email for cloaked
urls redirecting users to phishing sites. The dysfunctional urls in this email
are interpreted as such, and lots of warnings are inserted into the emails about
this, making them unreadable. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into http://gmail.google.com
2. Compose a new message in richtext (html) format
3. Paste html text containing url of the form
http://gamil.google.com/something-or-other
4. Mail it to some address and look at the html source of the resulting message
Actual Results:  
Absolute url got converted into a relative url

Expected Results:  
Should leave the url alone as absolute url.
