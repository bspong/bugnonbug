Switching between tabs blurs text in bookmarks toolbar and search bar
In certain situations when you have multiple tabs open, switching between them affects part of the text in the bookmarks toolbar. The text becomes bolder and darker. Often the more you switch, the darker and blurrier the text becomes. Mousing over the text restores it to normal.

The only text affected is that of a single bookmark button that happens to be situated over the right-most edge of the right-most tab being switched to/from. And only the part of the button text that is to the right of the tab edge, so half the button text can still appear normal. I'll attach a screenshot to illustrate.

This only occurs in nightly builds from 20060126 onwards. Not in the 1.8 branch.

It doesn't happen for all combinations of tabs, nor does it always happen immediately, so you may have to be persistent. If you switch between two empty tabs, for example, it won't occur. If you switch between slashdot.org and an empty tab, it should. If you switch between two Slashdot tabs, it doesn't seem to. Switching between an empty tab and one entirely void of any html seems to induce it as well, so I don't think it's related to any specific page type. Sometimes it won't happen for a little while and you have to change the tab order to induce it. Sometimes it'll fix the text when you switch back to the first tab, and other times it'll make the bug worse.

If you don't see this immediately, the easiest way to reproduce is probably to rename your profile and restart with a fresh profile. The browser will open with the default set of buttons on the bookmarks toolbar, and will automatically open the "Deer Park Alpha 1" home page. Create two new empty tabs. Then move the "Deer Park Alpha 1" tab to the far right. Start switching between it and the previous empty tab. The text just to the right of the tab should start to display the bug (see attached picture).

Possibly fall-out from bug 317375?
