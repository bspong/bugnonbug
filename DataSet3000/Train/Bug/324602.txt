Hangs CPU-bound preparing to print cheaptickets.com search results

I went to cheaptickets.com and searched for some flights (9 passengers
between SJS and SAL).
The query returns a long (22 page) result.  I typed ^P to print, and
a dialog popped up saying "Preparing print data" or something
similar.  It never finished, and Firefox did not respond to
clicking the close window-manager button.
-----------
Printing worked immediately under IE.
-----------
The Firefox hang happened on both Windows-XP and Linux (haven't tried Mac).
On Linux I ran 'top' and saw the the firefox process was 99% compute-bound.
I let it run about 10 minutes before killing the process.  Printing
simple web pages works fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit cheaptickets.com
2.Search for some flights, wait for query to finish with many results.
3.^P 

Actual Results:  
A dialog box pops up saying something about "preparing print data"
(or similar) [same dialog on Windows & Linux, so I'm certain that
the dialog is either part of Firefox or the web page].

Firefox goes compute-bound and never prints, and does not respond to clicking
the close icon on any window.

Expected Results:  
Printing.
