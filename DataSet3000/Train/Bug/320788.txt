I noticed a few times, as surfing on different sites at different times (broadband), that it is sometimes impossible to surf further on other pages (separation sheet, excuse me for my poor english.. :-) the french word is "onglet" and the german one is "trennblatt") as one separtion page is waiting for an object to be downloaded, espacially for example in case rich media advertisment. So long the page is waiting for the download, it is not possible to get to the other separations sheets during this time...

Ahhh.. excuse me but I just come this idea... why not help the reporting of a bugs by offering a dictionnary of the most used terms and expressions related to this software.. it will be more efficient for both parts: you.. and us!

Kind regards

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.get on a often asked page where a rich media content is to be find. The problem occure as the server are busy and the object also can't be downloaded immediatly
2.click to another separation page to try to surf another page...during the wainting time due to the download of the other page
3.just as the wished download is made, than it is possible to access to the other separation pages
