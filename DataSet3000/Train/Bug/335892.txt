trunk firefox (3.0a1) displays error message after exiting app in a system user profile that is not an administrator
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060428 Minefield/3.0a1

When logged onto a computer whose user account is not an administrator, after exiting a trunk version of firefox (Minefield 3.0a1), you get a message saying that memory could not be written.  I think this is because of the user account privledges, but I could be wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and use it normally.
2.Close Firefox

Actual Results:  
A dialog that looks like this pops up after exiting:

|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|firefox.exe - Application Error                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  X  The instruction at "xxxxxxxxxx" at "xxxxxxxxxx". The memory could|
|     not be "written".                                                |
|                                                                      |
|                 Click on OK to terminate the program                 |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|                                  |OK|                                |
|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

Expected Results:  
Firefox should exit without any backtalk :-P

Only tested on trunk, could somebody reproduce this on the Mozilla1.8 or Mozilla1.8.0 branch?

Also, another bug with a similar dialog exists in bug #326044 (please do not mark this or that bug as a dupe of any one of the bugs listed here)
