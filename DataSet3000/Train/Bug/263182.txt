Page Info (Security tab) doesn't explain mixed secure/insecure

In HTTPS sites that are setup so that some of the information is properly coming
through HTTPS but some of the info comes through insecure HTTP, the lock icon
changes to one with a slash in it (it didnt do that in previous releases- good
job!) However when you click on the lock to find out WHY this is the case, there
is no information, just the normal identity verified and connection encrypted
messages. There should be, in this special case, a little explanation as to why
the lock icon has the slash through it, and perhaps even a dialogue for the user
the first time such a situation is encountered.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit an HTTPS site where some of the elements come from a standard HTTP
connection
2.click on the lock icon with the slash through it
3.notice there is no mention as to WHY that slash is there

Actual Results:  
normal identity verified and connection encrypted messages

Expected Results:  
same but also mentioned that the page contained some insecure items and this was
the source of the broken lock
