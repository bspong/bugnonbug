Chessboard (graphic) renders incorrectly

URL points to US Chess Federation's online chess center. I am not a member, but
I managed to do a "Save Page..." when the rendering glitch popped up during a
friend's session (which was with Moz 1.7.5 under WinXP). 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag the page in the attached zipfile onto the icon or alias to Moz 1.7.5 or
FF 1.0.2, *without* having the browser open previously.
2. Note the (incorrectly rendered) lines of text "15   bxc3   Qc7" and "16  
Qa4+" above and below the fifth row of the chessboard.
3. Refresh the window to see the correct rendering.

Actual Results:  
Lines of text described above are interspersed with the graphic of the
chessboard, which is distracting and extremely annoying when trying to analyze a
position.

Expected Results:  
Rendered correctly, as it appears after a refresh.

Rendering glitch DOES NOT appear with the test case on Moz 1.7.6 (Mac 10.3.8),
but DOES appear on Moz 1.7.5 and FF 1.0.2 (Mac 10.3.8).

Rendering glitch DOES appear on Moz 1.7.5 (WinXP) while playing live on the
caissa.com site. During live play, refreshing the screen does NOT help.

Glitch does NOT appear with the test case on any of the combinations listed
above if the browser is already running when the test case is opened.

The consistent, semi-regular appearance of this rendering problem while playing
on the caissa site is the sole reason my friend uses IE on his machine (this
glitch has never happened with IE).

In case anyone has trouble reproducing it, I will attach a PDF screenshot in
addition to the saved test case page.

Possible related reports are bug 278126, bug 267457, bug 217677, bug 64817, bug
212715, bug 241135, bug 232345, and bug 254143. However I'm not a coder nor HTML
jockey, so I can't quite tell if this is the same as any of those. Apologies in
advance if this is in fact a dupe.
