Define reference platforms for official builds
This is a tracking bug to solicit input to define a reference platform for the three major platforms we ship on.

The specification for these reference platforms should not just include things like compiler toolchain, but the OS itself, any applied patches/security updates, any supporting tools (cygwin/darwinports wget/ssh, etc.) any extra downloads of tools (the MS compiler extensions come to mind), and anything else that's necessary to re-create a machine from the ground up to reproduce a build from a specific point in time.

The goal here is twofold:

1. Complete build [environment] reproducability.

2. To hold an explicit discussion about the support requirements for the environments we want the shipped bits to run on, which may be affected by the build enviornment. Translation: which Linux distros do we actually care about. We actually may be able to support more than we think if we think about it (see bug 329517). Of course, this impacts Macs as well (bug 327092, with its matrix of required-build-but-supported-runtime OSes), and Win32 (all the VC8 requests, including a specific statement about the support of various Win32 client OS versions for each branch) as well.

dbaron points out that this would be a nice opportunity to make profiling work again too.

This bug will block a bunch of upgrades, as it is our current intention to create machine (images, where possible) that meet the requirements specified in this bug, rather than replace/upgrade old tinderboxen, the contents of which we may need to reproduce older versions/builds.
