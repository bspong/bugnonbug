It is possible through general usage of the Add Bookmark dialog to make it such that it is too large to be resizable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ctrl-D to open Add Bookmark dialog
2. Stretch dialog to full height of your screen
3. Click Arrow to "Show all the bookmarks folders"
4. Close dialog (your settings should be preserved)
5. Ctrl-D again to open Add Bookmark dialog
6. Again stretch dialog to full height
7. Again click Arrow to "Show all the bookmarks folders"
8. Notice that the dialog exceeds the window height and cannot be resized down.  Since your settings get preserved, it becomes difficult to ever make this window smaller.




It would seem to me (empirically, not having looked at the code) that the math used to determine the total height of the dialog is adding extra n pixel height to accomodate for the bottom buttons.  It this situation where the usable area is already pushing the maximum size, this becomes a problem.
