Opening the "Customize" toolbar window hides "Done" button when Firefox's Title bar is near the bottom of desktop
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

If you right click on the toolbar (or menu) and go to "Customize" to customize
the toolbar with Firebird near the bottom of the screen, the Customize window
will appear and get cut off at the bottom.  The "Done" button will thus not be
visible and you won't be able to cancel the form.  Even if you move the
Browser's window, the Customize window will not move form its current possition
unless you add a new toolbar icon.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the main browser window for Firebird near the bottom of the desktop
2. Right click on the toolbar (or menu) and go to "Customize".
3. You'll notice the form that opens is cut-off by the bottom of the screen and
you can't access the "Done" button.


Expected Results:  
At least allow the Esc key to close the Customize toolbar window, and/or place
the "Done" button at the top of the form, and/or move the Customize toolbar
window with the main Browser's window if you move it.
