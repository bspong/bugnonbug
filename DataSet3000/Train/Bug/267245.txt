Checkbox "Alert me whenever I submit information that's not encrypted." is not checked by default
In the "Security Warning" dialogue, the checkbox "Alert me whenever I submit
information that's not encrypted." is unchecked by default.

This is inappropriate behaviour, which is not consistent with any other
well-written application, even with MS IE (AFAIA). In any case, user inaction
should not trigger such effects that could not be changed later, undermining
user's awareness of submitting information over unencrypted form. And as far as
I am aware, in Firefox there is no user interface that allows one to change the
behaviour back to status quo. 

This behaviour of not letting me know when I submit an unencrypted form
undermines my security, as in every new installation, should I forget to change
the checkbox to "always alert me" the first time, the checkbox is lost forever
from my UI, and there is no way for me, as the end user, to find it and change
it back to normal. 

Please, consider this bug seriously. Attempts to make Firefox more user-friendly
should know its limits, and such features, which even Microsoft does not employ
(AFAIA), will not do any good to mozilla.org products in the long run. A few
months from now, and MS IE is going to be a much more secure browser than
Firefox is, should we continue in this way of making the browser for dummies who
do not care about security. 

(Tested with Firefox 1.0RC1. )

Solution: to solve the problem, one must change the default value of
"security.warn_submit_insecure.show_once" and such to false (and leave
"security.warn_submit_insecure" and such as true, just as they are now).
