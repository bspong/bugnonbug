many broken images

While using a slow Internet connection (cable modem 128/64, Indonesia) and opening some concurrent tabs with images, many (especially the larger) images are broken/only loaded partially.
I suspect the originating server somehow reset the connection, but a forced reload (CTRL-R) or a "view image" always shows the broken image again (When clearing the complete cache, then reloading, everything is ok).
The strange thing is that the downloadmanager is able to download the complete image correctly (via "save image as"). Couldn't the behaviour be changed to be like the downloadmanager (full image when reloading), or maybe even include a (configurable) automatic retry at tcp connection reset?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open many tabs including images (on a slow connection)
2.wait until throbber indicates everything is loaded completely
3.check for missing or broken images in all tabs

Actual Results:  
Some images were missing completely, some where only partially loaded. The partially loaded images couldn't be correctly reloaded via CTRL-R or "view image", they remained partial.

Expected Results:  
All images should be loaded completely.
In case of partially loaded images, a reload should load the full image.

The problem could be only occuring on slow connections (the international bandwith from here is a joke).
Nevertheless, I'm seeing the problem every day, so I suspect a lot of people in countries with slower Internet Infrastructure are seeing it too.
