Visit a site that requires the java 2 plugin. The plugin downloads and installs
successfully using the normal procedure. After installing the plugin and
visiting a site that uses the newly downloaded plugin Phoenix ends immediately.

Note:
After removing the plugin by deleting the newly created java2 directory from
phoenix/plugins, phoenix functions normally again. 
Went back to duplicate the procedure and the download and intall gets stuck at
the installing phase where before everything downloaded and installed in the
normal way. Same result though. Phoenix will crash immediately when visiting
ipix.com as though the plubin install had completed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit www.ipix.com for example
2.Download Java 2 Linux-plugin (shows Java 2 1.3 at top of popup) when requested
to do so.
3.After successful installation reload or open a new window at www.ipix.com. 
4.Phoenix crashes.
5.Start Phoenix again and visit same page and it will immediately crash

Actual Results:  
Phoenix crashes when visiting a java enabled site. 

Expected Results:  
Run whatever java program throuh the newly installed java plugin

Running the coffee theme. Digger v0.5.0 is the only extension installed. Have
had no other wierdness except when installing the java plugin.
