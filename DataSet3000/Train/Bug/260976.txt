The page itself has javascript protection to stop it being viewed on its own.
From www.runescape.com click on 'play game' then 'high detail' then any world.

On the game with the Java applet there is a navigation bar with links on. The
worldmap link ALWAYS works because the page it loads contains no frameset. The
other links target new pages which contain a frameset. The new page appears and
the source of that page is correct, but the inner frames contents are not always
loaded, so the page appears blank.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit www.runescape.com
2. click play game
3. select high detail
4. select any world
5. select the 'manual' link from teh navigation bar

Actual Results:  
The page that pops up (as a result of the href targetting an unknown frame)
appears blank because the frameset contents have not loaded

Expected Results:  
Frameset should have loaded the inner frame pages and displayed their contents
correctly.
