All is in the title.

It breaks since this morning. I grabbed 3 times sources, and bug is present.

See steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Grab a 0.8 firebird branch build
2.Update it
3.Launch build process.

Actual Results:  
Breaking in nsAccessibilityService.cpp

Expected Results:

Here is the log when building is killed :

It seems to be related to firebird trunk checkin for bug #227690.
