Yahoo! games runs into Java error (Poker in this case), then Firefox crashes...just started happening on Monday

Yahoo! games (Poker in my case) fails with some kind of Java error even though
Java is enabled.  When I open the particular 'poker room' in Yahoo!  It says
Java is not enabled, but it is.  Then within seconds, Firefox fails.  This did
not happen ever before Monday.  Now it is also happening if I use Netscape as
well.  Neither happened previously to Monday.

This happens every time and usually forces me to restart my iBook.  Yahoo!s
response was that Games do not work with newer versions of Netscape or any
version of Firefox.  Since I have been using both for months without any issues
at Yahoo! Games, I wonder if they changed something.  They do say I can use an
older version of Netscape, but why?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open Yahoo! Games
2.  Select Hold'em Poker, and a new window opens with the different games available
3.  Before displaying, it gets an error with Java then crashes Firefox

Actual Results:  
Crashes Firefox and usually forces a complete restart of my iBook

Expected Results:  
Open and play

Additionally, Talkback is now refusing to send the error report, the queue just
keeps building up and never is able to send.

If this can not be addressed, I will need to find another browser to work
with...I can not keep having the machine crash.
