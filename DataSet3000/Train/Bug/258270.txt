I need to order products from http://www.ahrendonline.nl/. I need to search for
 products using the search form on the top left side, specifically the "Zoek op
woorden" (search by keyword) input box (the second one).

With Firefox 0.8 I could use this form. With Firefox 0.9.3 I can't get the form
to submit; clicking on the 'Zoek' (search) image will select it (or at least,
grey it), pressing enter or space bar doesn't seem to do anything at all.

I checked the source but did not see any obvious problems; in fact, it appears
that this is a simple webform that uses an <input type="image"> as a submit button.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ahrendonline.nl/
2. Enter a keyword in the second text input on the top left side (below "Zoek op
woorden"), for example "muis" (mouse)
3. Try and submit the form using the button ("Zoek", search)

Actual Results:  
The button got selected

Expected Results:  
The form should have been submitted.

Firefox 0.9.3 compiled from FreeBSD ports. Fresh profile install on this version.
