I don't like PDFs to open as browser plugin, so I configured Fx to open them in an external Acroread window (AcroRd32.exe version 5.1.0). I use most programms in maximised mode, so if I open Acroread by hand or by opening a PDF from WinExplorer, it opens maximised (because it remembers its last state). If Acroread is already running when I click a PDF in Fx, this Acroread is used correctly. But if Acroread is not running, Fx starts it and changes the Acroread window mode to "windowed". This is annoying.
I also tested it with Acroread windowed with a special window size (and then closed). Then Fx changes the window size to a default when opening it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure Fx to open PDFs in an external Acroread window
2. start Acroread and choose a special window size or mode maximised
3. close Acroread
4. click a PDF in Fx

Actual Results:  
Acroread opens with a Fx provided default window size.

Expected Results:  
Acroread should open with it's own remembered window size and mode.

Fx 1.0 didn't do this, it correctly opened Acroread without affecting Acroreads remembered state.
What mysterious things does Fx 1.5 do? If it only would call AcroRd32.exe without any gimmicks, this problem shouldn't happen.
