I have tried to import a standard certificate without keys into the Firefox
through web page access and from the Other People's tab, but it wasnot possible,
nothing happens.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
first time you need certificates:

1) go to the page:
http://www.netlock.net/index.cgi?lang=EN&tem=ANONYMOUS/kereses/tanusitban.tem
2) push the button - Search
3) select the triangle before any "személyes aláíró" or "munkatársi alaíró"
certificate
4) try to import them selecting on the next page "Cert import"
5) Save them to file, and try to import them
Point 4) and 5) will not work.


Actual Results:  
It is impossible to import certificates for other peoples with Firefox

Expected Results:  
It should be imported well.

I thint, it is the same problem like you find in the Thunderbird.

When the Mozilla products were separated, (the mail, and the browser) there was
not any option to import the CRL-s, because normaly you do it with browser.

Normally in an integrated suite like mozilla suite, other people's tab is
filling with the mailer (you get a mail with certificate), and to import
certificate here maybe was forgotten.
