Many pictures and order forms do not show up when browsing (Apple.com).  Also does not work in Windows Firefox

When you start browsing apple.com's shopping site, the online order forms never
show up.  The pictures also don't show up when browsing through their products.
 This same issue occurs on the Windows version.  I have opened up Safari, and
Apple's site displays correctly, and I can select a computer/component to
purchase, and start filling out my order form.  As you may see, the Apple Store
is quite barren.

I am using OS 10.4.1 on a Macintosh 1.33ghz Powerbook.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the website link given.
2. Start browsing Apple's Store
3. Act like you want to buy a G5, and click on the order button

Actual Results:  
You will see all the models of the G5's, with prices and specs, but you don't
see the picture above it, and no SELECT buttons for the model you want to
purchase online.  You can't even get to the order form.  Other browsers don't
have this problem.

Expected Results:  
Buttons and pictures should have shown up, and I should have been able to order
products from Apple's Store with their online order forms.
