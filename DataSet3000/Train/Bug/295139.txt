Firefox displays Prometric's test-date selection calendar incorrectly

I signed up for an exam which according to the calendar on Prometric's website,
let me select Saturday the 20th of 2005. Well, the 20th is a Friday, and I did
not realize this until I showed up on Saturday to take the exam only to be told
I was out of $125 for missing it the prior day. The calendar's days are not
aligned correctly using Firefox, but the problem is non-existant using Internet
Explorer. Perhaps Prometric doesn't care how their site looks outside of IE? Or
perhaps this is really a Firefox bug? Either way, now I'm out of $125 for zero
services rendered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto Prometric.com
2. Click Test Takers to advance to the scheduling section
3. Attempting to schedule and exam draws a calendar with the days in the wrong
alignment.

Actual Results:  
A calendar used to select the test date appears wrong. The days, listed
horizontally by letter, do not align with the correct DATE of the month.

Expected Results:  
The days in the calendar should align with the date of the month.
