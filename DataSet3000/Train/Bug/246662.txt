For each button image on the lefthand side the button is supposed to look
depressed while the mouse is over it (onmouseover) and pop back up when the
mouse leaves that area (onmouseout).  The button depresses properly when the
mouse moves over it, but as soon as the cursor stops moving the button pops back
up.  If you move the cursor again it triggers the onmouseover code properly
again, but the onmouseout code is triggered again as soon as the cursor stops
moving.  I loaded the page in IE and it worked properly, I also replaced the
(mindbendingly complex) javascript code on the website with simple javascript
specific to each button and the problem persisted.

Should be simple to fix.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web page with an image that has onMouseOut code to change the image.
2. Move the cursor over the image.
3. Stop moving the cursor.

Actual Results:  
The onMouseOut code executes as soon as the cursor stops moving.

Expected Results:  
The onmouseout code should only execute once the mouse has left the area of the
image.
