Bookmarks Toolbar slow to appear at launch

At times, the bookmarks in the main Bookmarks Toolbar take roughly 10 seconds to appear after the window seems to have fully loaded at launch.  "Show Places" apepars in the corner, but no bookmarks or bookmark folders appear, and clicking where they would appear has no effect.

Once the bookmarks have appeared, behavior is normal for the remainder of the session.

This problem is intermittent.  I have not been able to determine exactly what circumstances cause it, but it appears to be more common after importing data (in particular, I'm importing Safari's default bookmarks).  One launch may show the problem when the previous and succeeding launches don't.  On average it seems to happen once every 2 to 4 launches, once it's started happening at all.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Optional: Create a new Firefox profile, then import data from Safari
2. Launch Firefox
3. Watch Bookmarks Toolbar

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks don't appear until roughly 10 seconds have passed.

Expected Results:  
Bookmarks should appear more or less immediately.
