The game linked here : http://www.javapause.com/games/jack is a java applet (using the java plug-in > 1.4) with added support for OpenGL calls (from the JOGL team).
When played, the game displays a fps counter. As vsync is programmaticaly disabled, the frame rate should be around 300 fps on any recent computer with recent opengl drivers. This is the case for every browser tested (IE 6, Opera 8.5, ...). 
On windows (at least XP) FF and mozilla aren't able to display more than 30 fps.
On some computers, the problem doesn't show (recent ogl drivers in both cases).
The problem is found with both ATI and NVIDIA cards, and can be reduced to a very long time (10 ms) spend in the glSwapBuffers() calls.

See this link for a detailed technical explanation from one of the JOGL team member : http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/cgi_directory/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=9;t=000645

Could it that there's a kind of a kind of double buffering involved with ff that prevent the game running at full speed ?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go the the game link
2. once the starter applet is loaded, click on play to go to the opengl applet page
3. once the game is loaded (4 megs at least), click on play 
Actual Results:  
watch the fps counter in the top left corner. on IE it's above 200, on FF it's under 30


Expected Results:  
at least 200 fps on a modern pc with NVIDIA or ATI card

this problem seems to occur only on windows oses. 

It runs fine on mac os (160 fps here) with the latest ff (downloaded today)

This is a showstopper for the game and this new technology. I hope it will be addessed soon !
