HELP!!  Firefox won't open (play) music sample links on Amazon.com!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

go to any cd on amazon and scroll down to the sample tracks.  first, with
foxfire, you only get two choices -- realplayer and media player.  the listings
for amazon's own player doesn't even show up.  second, when you go to click on
the link to listen to a song sample, you get a download box only.  third, and
get this, the download box doesn't even have an "open" option.  that is grayed
out.  you must download the .exe file!!!!!!!  that's an .exe file that always
playes on msie browser and consists of a 30 second song sample.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any amazon.com cd for sale, and scroll down to "samples of songs"
2. you'll only see links for two players (msie reveals links for three players)
3. the links won't play when clicked.  instead, you'll get a download dialogue
4. even the download box will be half "grayed out." 

Actual Results:  
it's what DOESN'T happen.  you don't get a sound sample.

Expected Results:  
the pluggins, which my system has loaded, should have just played the song samples.

i have pluggins downloaded for all the major players.  if firefox won't play
amazon song samples with a click, we've got a problem.

AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE???  MY FIREFOX HAS ALWAYS SUCCESSFULLY PLAYED LINKS
REQUIRING REALPLAYER OR MEDIA PLAYER AT OTHER SITES, SO I ASSUME THE PLUGINS ARE
IN PLACE.  SAME FOR QUICKTIME. HOW CAN I CHECK THIS.  HOW CAN WE MAKE AMAZON
SONG SAMPLES PLAY???

PLEASE HELP!

THANKS,
