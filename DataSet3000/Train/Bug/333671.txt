Form checkboxes do not check when using spacebar and quickly tabbing through elements.

When I am quickly entereing info into a form using the keyboard sometimes checkboxes will not check. I use tab to tab between elements and the spacebar to check checkboxes and radio buttons. If I go slow, everything works fine, but if I speed up the checkbox does not check. This is most easily shown with a login that has an option to save the session as a cookie. You would type your login, tab, type password, tab, hit space for a "Remember me on this computer" or such, tab, hit space on Login or Submit button. If you go too fast the check box for remembering info will not get checked.

I have experienced this on 3 different installs, on both Linux and Windows, in versions 1.5, 1.5.0.1, and older 1.0.x versions. It is quite annoying sometimes.



Hope I wasn't too confusing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with a login and an option to save login in a cookie.
2. Quickly: Enter login name, press tab, enter password, tab, press spacebar for saving login, press tab, press spacebar for Submit/Login button.

Actual Results:  
Checkbox would not be checked.

Expected Results:  
Checkbox should be checked.

Has done this for me on multipe sites.
