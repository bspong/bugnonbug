Crash on startup on Debian stable; relocation error.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040615 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Nightly CVS, 2004-07-13.;

I'm trying to build nightly CVS, since there aren't Debian packages for 0.9, but
the built binary is missing symbols.  When I run (the newly installed) firefox
from the shell:

   eigg:cjb~ % time /usr/local/bin/firefox                                        
   /usr/local/bin/firefox  0.46s user 0.11s system 72% cpu 0.784 total
   eigg:cjb~ % echo $?                                                            
   1

.. the shell script returns 1 after less than a second, with nothing happening
on my X display.  When I try running the binary manually:

   eigg:cjb~ % /usr/local/lib/firefox-0.9.1+/firefox-bin                          
   /usr/local/lib/firefox-0.9.1+/firefox-bin: relocation error:
   /usr/local/lib/firefox-0.9.1+/firefox-bin: undefined symbol:
   _t12nsCharTraits1ZUs.sEmptyBuffer

Any ideas?  Again, this is a Debian/stable system.  No special client.mk options
other than adding -j6.  Optimise on, debug off.  I *can* run
/usr/local/bin/firefox -ProfileManager and create a new profile, but launching
firefox with the newly created profile just exhibits the same quick
return-to-shell. 

The system is a 4*2.6GHz P4, 2G RAM, /home on NFS.
