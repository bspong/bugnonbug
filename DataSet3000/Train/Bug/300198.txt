Set loadFolderAndReplace default to "false"

As described in bug 216346, there is a preference
"browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace" which controls whether a middle-click on a
bookmark folder will replace the current tabs, or create new tabs.

The resolution of that bug was INVALID, with the rationale "there is a pref
available, so the bug as it stands is invalid". I do not agree that resolution
is in the spirit of the original issue, but alas. I have filed this bug to
address not the ability, but the default behavior of Firefox.

Due to the destructive nature of the default behavior, the high number of
duplicates in the aforementioned bug, and the other rationale (in particular in
my comment no. 33 [1]), I believe that the default for this preference should be
set to ‘false’, causing bookmark folders to open in new tabs instead.

This will impact few users negatively, and many positively, in particular your
average grandfather, but also regular users like me who have good motoristic
mouse control skills but still run into this issue multiple times. For the
people who depend on the current behavior, I do not think the new behavior would
be particularly bothersome, and if they feel it is, they can be considered
‘power users’ and be told to change this preference accordingly.
