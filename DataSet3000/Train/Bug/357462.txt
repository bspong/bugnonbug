Probelm 1, intermiten when working in a tab usually the last tab to right, the page will freeze, cpu spikes, I hit reload and sometime this fixes the problem.

Also home page issue:

I have 3 tabs set open when browser is started. Yahoo, google. neopets.
That works fine, but when I am using one of the tab for example the tab that has google on it. when I am done searching on that tab and want to bring it back I hit the home button, problem is all three tabs either reset, and worse the browser open 3 new tabs of the same web pages, I can do this several time and have a huge amount of tabs when I am done.

Perhaps you set up the home button to open set # of tabs when no tabs open. when tabs are open and home page button is clicked then only the active tab will go back top its set home page! And put an optin in for that, as well have an option for it to not open all set tabs again

thanks
