Bad live bookmark causes Firefox content / memory usage to grow endlessly until OOM and crash
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

My Firefox (1.0.7) started having problems exactly like what is described at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Memory_Leak: "Memory usage will be seen to increase dramatically even though Firefox use itself is dormant or static".

I found that this happened because one of my live bookmarks had gone bad. URL http://goldenspud.com/webrog/feed/ starts as a correct XML feed, but soon starts repeating a warning message indefinitely. Firefox doesn't notice this and loads hundreds of megs of the error message, and eventually crashes.

When Firefox loads a live bookmark, it should check that the XML file does not contain errors like this. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks
2. Select File->New Live Bookmark
3. Type feed location: http://goldenspud.com/webrog/feed/ (This is the feed that is not working now, on 27 Oct 2005)
4. Click OK. Open processes pane in Windows task manager and follow Firefoxes memory usage.
5. Continue browsing, the problem shuld appear almost immediately.

Actual Results:  
Firefox memory consumption starts increasing rapidly, even when you do nothing (probably depends on speed of your internet connection). Firefox crashes at random (usually when you close it). 


Expected Results:  
Firefox should give an error message about incorrect feed and should not crash or leak memory.
