Discovered feeds aren't cleared on loads in background tabs (refresh or drag and drop)

XML feeds that are defined in <link> tags and show up in the Firefox RSS button
menu in the bottom-right corner ("Subscribe to '..' ") keep adding up to produce
infinite duplicates when a page is set to refresh with <meta> tags AND the
meta-refreshing tab is not selected. When the tab is reloaded by hand OR
selected and refreshed by the meta-refresh, the list gets cleared correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox, open two tabs
2. In other tab go to http://www.rakkis.net/firefox-rssbutton-metareload-bug.html
3. Select any other tab
4. Wait 20 seconds.
5. Select the tab in which the first link was opened; you can now see that the
two RSS feeds defined in the site appear multiple times when you click on the
small RSS button to bring up the "Subscribe to '..' " menu. When you refresh the
page by hand, or wait another 10 seconds when the page is selected, the menu
gets cleared up correctly and only 2 feeds show up.
Actual Results:  
Multiple (duplicate) items of the two RSS feeds defined in the page HTML appear
in the RSS button menu.

Expected Results:  
The RSS button menu should clear every time the page is reloaded, so that only
two RSS feeds (as defined by the HTML) appear always there.
