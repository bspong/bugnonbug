The default Firefox theme on Windows does not conform to the Windows scrollable
component guidelines. The Firefox theme has the scrollable area at the same
depth of the surrounding window and the scrollbars are raised above the window.

Windows scrollable components, on the other hand, have a double inset border
around the scrollable area. The scrollbar is then placed at the same depth of
the content and inside the double inset border. This makes the scrollbar lower
than the depth of the window.

Expected Results:  
The default Firefox theme on Windows should conform to the Windows look and feel
with respect to scrollable components.

A current workaround is to include this in the "userChrome.css" file:
====
vbox#appcontent {
  border-right: 1px solid ThreeDHighlight;
  border-bottom: 1px solid ThreeDHighlight;
  border-left: 1px solid ThreeDShadow;
}
tabbrowser#content {
  border-top: 1px solid ThreeDDarkShadow;
  border-right: 1px solid ThreeDFace;
  border-bottom: 1px solid ThreeDFace;
  border-left: 1px solid ThreeDDarkShadow;
}
