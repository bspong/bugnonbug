Firefox ignores the "AXPress" action

Firefox on OS X does not respond correctly to the "AXPress" action. This can be verified directly using the Accessibility Inspector from the Apple develop tools to inspect the close button of a Firefox window.

This is a failure of Firefox 1.5 to integrate itself with the OS X accessibility framework. It will break tools that depend on that framework in order to close Firefox windows. For instance, it breaks Witch preference pane app, which cannot close a firefox window.  It probably also breaks parts of the routine OS X accessibility support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and open a secondary window
2. Start the Apple Accessibility Inspector and inspect ("lock on") the window's close button
3. Try to close the window by performing the AXPress action.

Actual Results:  
The window does not close.

Expected Results:  
The window should close.
