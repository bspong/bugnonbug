using firefox RC1
when using firefox in normal web browsing
at the beginning of the page, the vertical scrollbar 100% vertical, if you click on it and drag it down, it ignores mouse input. if you use the keyboard to move the page down at all, the vertical scrollbar starts working.
if you take it back to the top it stops working again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open any web page taller than 1 screen (with active vertical scrollbar)
2. click on the blue "handle" in the vertical scrollbar at the top of the page
3. drag it down as far as you want
Actual Results:  
the handle (and web page) will not move at all.


Expected Results:  
the displayed area of the web page will scroll down (the contents will move up)

this was not on my PC, it was on a friend's mac, so i don't have full OS version details. 

i searched for mac scrollbar mouse and looked at all the bugs and didn't see this already listed. however it seems like a fairly huge bug so i wonder if it's already been reported somewhere.
