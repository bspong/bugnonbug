In Cocoa browsers like Camino and Safari, clicking in the address bar places the
cursor at that point, so the address can be edited.  Cmd-L is for selecting the
entire field so that one can go to a new location without having to reach for
the mouse (going to a new location from the address bar requires keyboard input
anyway).

In Firefox, clicking on the address bar selects the whole address bar so getting
to the cursor for editing, say adding a period, requires two single-clicks.  A
double-click, by the way, selects a single word.  Selecting the entire address
bar should not be the default action for single-clicking the address bar, since
keyboard input is always desired next and selecting the address bar can be
achieved from the keyboard with Cmd-L.  Editing the address, on the other hand,
is served well by mouse input so the cursor can (or should) be placed at a
particular, desired point as simply as possible.


Also, Cocoa text fields allow for emacs bindings (built-in for Cocoa
applications in Mac OS X).  Ctrl-K to "kill" the rest of the line is extremely
handy for navigating to an upper-level of the website from the address bar.
