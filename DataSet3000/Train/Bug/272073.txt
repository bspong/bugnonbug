After importing huge number of IE bookmarks, Firefox will not load, freezes and crashes.

When installing firefox on a friends computer, (this one), I imported IE's
settings.  Then when I started firefox, it loaded, and the 4 bookmarks that
actually showed up all started with "!" or "#", and were advertisment related. 
the large number of bookmarks being loaded caused firefox to freeze and crash.

I deleted the profile folder, and restarted firefox but without importing IE's
stuff, and it worked fine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a huge number of bookmarks (I have no idea how many, but probably hundreds)
2. Run Firefox with the default setup including bookmark bar showing.

Actual Results:  
firefox crashed.

Expected Results:  
No crash.

This was a computer that was infested with spyware which I had removed, but the
bookmarks were left behind I guess.  Interestingly, they didn't show up in IE,
so i'm not sure where Firefox found them to import.  SP2 was installed, so maybe
that had something to do with it.
