While clicking and holding on the close button rendering stops (in chrome and content)

Some sites pop up screenshots / images in new windows. I tend to click and hold
on the popup's close button until I've seen the image and then let go to close
the window. However, pressing and holding on the close button stops any visible
rendering. As soon as I move the pointer off the close button and let go of the
button the content of the window renders.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new Firefox window
2. While the content is loading, click and hold on the close button for a
longish time.
3. Move the pointer away from the close button, and let go.

Actual Results:  
At '2' no content is rendered for as long as you hold down the button.

At '3' content is immediately rendered.

Expected Results:  
I would have expected Firefox to render all chrome (status bar changes, mouse
over effects on buttons, etc) and the canvas contents, regardless of the status
of the close button.
