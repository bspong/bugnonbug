Firefox does not automatically supply credentials from a URL again, after connection times out
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

I have a server that I connect to which requires credentials to log in.  It times out after so many minutes so you have to supply the credentials again.

I have bookmarked, for example: http://username:password@192.168.0.1/index.html

This works.

However, once the connection has timed out to the server and I attempt to load it up again from the bookmark - it pops up with a message box asking for the credentials.

I have to restart Firefox to make the bookmark supply the credentials automatically again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a site which requires credentials, eg. http://username:password@hostname
2. Bookmark the above URL
3. Access the above bookmark
4. Let the connection time out (in my example my router times out after 5 minutes)
5. Attempt accessing the above bookmark

Actual Results:  
It pops up with a message box asking for username and password, even though they are supplied in the URL.

Expected Results:  
It should simply pass the credentials in the URL to the server again, but it doesn't.

Maybe a trivial bug to some, but this is plain annoying for me, as I access my router on a regular basis checking up on my crappy MaxADSL connection.

It is not an issue with my router as the URL works perfectly the first time and works again once Firefox has been restarted.
