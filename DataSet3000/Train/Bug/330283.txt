browscap.ini doesn't have any information on firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

If you want to detect the browser on the server side there's a file called C:\WINDOWS\system32\inetsrv\browscap.ini that tells IIS how to read the HTTP_USER_AGENT string. Unfortunately it hasn't any information on firefox and it assigns most properties to zero or false.

This is more of a request rather than a bug. It would be nice to provide an updated version of browscap.ini somewhere on the mozilla website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install/configure IIS on XP
2. create an ASP called browser.asp and place the following code inside
(taken from http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/asp/121798.htm)
<%
' create an instance of the Browser Capabilities component
Set browserdetect = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.BrowserType")

' find some properties of the browser being used to view this page
browser=browserdetect.Browser
version=browserdetect.Version
majorver=browserdetect.Majorver
minorver=browserdetect.Minorver
platform=browserdetect.Platform
frames=browserdetect.Frames
tables=browserdetect.Tables
cookies=browserdetect.Cookies
javascript=browserdetect.JavaScript

' send some output to the web browser
response.write ("Browser: " & browser & "<BR>")
response.write ("Version: " & version & "<BR>")
response.write ("Majorver: " & majorver & "<BR>")
response.write ("Minorver: " & minorver & "<BR>")
response.write ("Platform: " & platform & "<BR>")
response.write ("Supports frames: " & frames & "<BR>")
response.write ("Supports tables: " & tables & "<BR>")
response.write ("Supports cookies: " & cookies & "<BR>")
response.write ("Supports JavaScript: " & javascript & "<BR>")
%>

3. point your browser to http://localhost/bowser.asp

Actual Results:  
Version: 0.0
Majorver: 0
Minorver: 0
Platform: unknown
Supports frames: False
Supports tables: True
Supports cookies: False
Supports JavaScript: False

Expected Results:  
Version: 1.5
Majorver: 1
Minorver: 5
Platform: WinNT
Supports frames: True
Supports tables: True
Supports cookies: True
Supports JavaScript: True

This is not a bug but a request. Please provide an updated browscap.ini cause I'm to lazy to do it myself. Of course by doing it you encourage people who host websites and developers to use Firefox :)
