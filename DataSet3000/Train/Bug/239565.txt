Save as Type (in Save Page As) is blank when page is XHTML

When attempting to save an XHTML page with the .xhtml extension and served as
application/xhtml+xml, the "Save As Type" dropdown menu is blank. If you attempt
to save an XHTML file without the filename in the URL, the menu correctly says
"Extensible Hypertext Markup Language," e.g.:
http://www.foo.com/ (pointing to index.xhtml) will work, but
http://www.foo.com/index.xhtml will not.

Although the menu is broken, I can still hit Save and get an XHTML file with the
.xhtml extension.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load an XHTML page with the .xhtml extension.
2. File -> Save Page As
3. Look at Save as type
Actual Results:  
"Save as type" line is blank; dropdown menu is empty.

Expected Results:  
Web Page, Complete
Web Page, XHTML Only
Text File

I'm not sure, but I think SeaMonkey had the right options in its menu when I
tried it a few days ago.

Go to http://home.cwru.edu/~cxa25/xhtml/ if you need to see what happens with
the filename not explicitly in the URL bar.
