input elements disabled / url and google search input areas do not allow input - restart needed

Everything works perfectly for a while (can be hours of browsing many pages).
Then it suddenly prevents me from entering or modifying the url or entering a
search term. Clicking onto another application's text box (just so the cursor
appears) such as Mail.app or camino or just invoking the hotkeys for Launchbar
are enough to re-enable the functionality in Firefox, but only momentarily.
Mozilla and Camino do not have this behavior. It started for me on one of the
big version updates... was it from .7x to .8? I'm sorry I don't remember.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Use the browser normally.
The last time this occurred was after opening a new window. In fact, it just
happened. I also just clicked in the next ("Actual Results") box trying to paste
some text, and while the cursor was there, the text was pasted back in this box.
I can't change that behavior. So this whole problem appears to be focus related.

Actual Results:  
Whoa, maybe I just learned something: I just opened a new window and it was
"dead" as described above. However what seemed to be happening was that focus
was left on *this* page, as I had to click on the title bar to regain focus
here, and the text I had just typed appeared in this box.


Expected Results:  
Changed focus and allowed me to type a url in the new window's url box.
