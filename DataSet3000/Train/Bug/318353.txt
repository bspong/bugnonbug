I am running Windows 98 and Windows XP Pro under Virtual PC 6.1.1 and Mac OS 10.4.3.  I downloaded the Firefox 1.5 installer, and installed Firefox 1.5 onto the Win 98 Virtual Machine with no problems.  However, the installation aborted on the Win XP Pro Virtual machine. I can generate an Error Report, but unfortunately, I cannot copy and paste its voluminous contents.
