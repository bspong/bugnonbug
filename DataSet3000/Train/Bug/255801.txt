There is a very peculiar order to the context menu as it currently exists. I am
suggesting reordering the menu so that it makes intrinsic sense and respects the
popularity of the individual options.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on a tab
Actual Results:  
Current Order:

New Tab
------
Reload Tab
Reload All Tabs
Close Other Tab
------
Close All Tabs

Expected Results:  
Proposed Order:

New Tab
Reload Tab
Close Tab
---
Reload All Tabs
Close Other Tabs

OR

New Tab
-----
Reload Tab
Reload All Tabs
-----
Close Tab
Close Other Tabs

The first suggestion orders based on the number of tabs you are working with and
the second order separates based on the action you wish to perform. Either of
these orders are preferable to the current order but i would rather see the
first on implemented because i feel that single tab operations are more popular
and should be easier to access. Comments/criticism welcome.
