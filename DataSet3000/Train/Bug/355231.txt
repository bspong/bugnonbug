.tabs-alltabs-stack should be 24 pixels wide instead of 18.  By widening .tabs-alltabs-stack, it both makes it easier to click on and, more importantly, it will allow for at least 2 ways at 1280 width for fixed width tabs to perfectly fill the scrollbox with it still present.

Example:
18 is divisible by 2,3,6,9,18
24 is divisible by 2,3,4,6,8,12,24

Having 2 or 3 tabs fixed width filling the scrollbox with no overflow are obviously useless.  However, the bigger problem is that the rest of the components on the tab bar have widths that are divisible by both 4 AND 6, making .tabs-alltabs-stack the odd one out.  So, by then having .tabs-alltabs-stack width equal to 18, it takes away all the possible multiples of 4.  (for reference, .scrollbutton-up and .scrollbutton-down-stack add up to 36 pixels, the close button at the right is 24 pixels if enabled, I am assuming that .tabs-left has been removed by editing userChrome.css for simplicity)

Here I will compare having 3,4,6,8,12,24 as the possible number of fixed width tabs to perfectly fill the scrollspace without overflow to 3,6,9,18, each at 1280 width resolution.

As 1280 minus 18 or 1280 minus 24 are already not divisible by 3,6,9,12, 18, or 24, that immediately limits the first set to only 4 or 8 as possibilities, but even worse, it limites the second set to none (which is the bug).

By making .tabs-alltabs-stack 24 pixels wide it would open up these possibilities, and would also open up even more possibilities at other resolutions, for example, at 1152 width.
