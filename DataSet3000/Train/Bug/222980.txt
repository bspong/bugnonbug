I don't want to save cookies from every site that tries to set them.  So I have
"Ask" checked.  But there are some sites I trust that are OK, I don't need to be
bothered.  I have checked "Apply to all cookies from this site" in the
Accept/Deny box when I click Accept, and they're listed in the "Exceptions". 
But every time, I still get asked.

I can accept this is working according to a strict interpretation of "Ask".  If
so, as a usability issue, there should be a choice meaning "Ask if it's a site
not already in the Exceptions to accept or deny.  If it's there, handle it as
instructed and don't pester me."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set "Ask" in privacy preferences
2. Visit a site wanting to set a cookie, check "Use for all...", accept.
3. Return to site, or go to a different page on site wanting to set another cookie.

Actual Results:  
Nag, nag, nag.

Expected Results:  
"I told you once, I trust this place.  Quit asking about it."
