could not load any pages after automatic update of firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

A pop-up indicated that an update for firefox had been loaded and that I needed to restart to complete the process. I complied and when firefox came up it gave an error saying it could not find the page. In fact it could not find any page c.f. my.yahoo.com/www.google.com/www.mozilla.com all of which were found with no problems using either mozilla, netscape or EVEN internet explorer. After rebooting the problem still occured. I tried reloading the latest version of firefox but it stalled out (28.8 KB dial-up) so I reinstalled Firefox 1.0 from a file I had lying around. I do object to being updated without asking my permission since this problem seems to occur with each new release. I love firefox and all it's features and use it exclusively. Any help would be appreciated.
thnx steve

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Allow firefox to do the automatic update
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
displayed a message could not find page with a box for try again

Expected Results:  
firefor should find the page

After the reboot firefox came up as usual displaying my home page which is a local file. Any attempt to load pages using bookmarks or full url's gave a page saying unable to load www..... and a button for try again which always gave the same results.  I was able to load the same pages using mozilla or other browsers. It seems that this problem always occurs on a new update FOR ME so there might be something missing on my system excpet version 1.0 works fine and I seem to have to come back to it every time.
