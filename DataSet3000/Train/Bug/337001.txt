CSS class definition appears to be ignored when displaying <select> and <option>, but embedded style works

The summary says it all, really.  I can declare a class for a select or option, but as far as I can tell, it's totally ignored.  If I embed the same stylistic values in a style= tag, though, that appears to work (I've not done any real investigation).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a class in a css sheet, apply the class to a select, observe output
2. Define an embedded style with the same values as are in the class, observe output
3.



Expected Results:  
I expected the <select> and its <option>s to reflect the stylistic values defined by the class, but they didn't.

I've listed this bug at the 'normal' level rather than 'trivial' because select/option seem to be the only html operators that are unresponsive to css class definitions (I might be wrong about that; I've not tried to investigate every operator).  Also, having to insert an explicit style description in every instance of those operators is a bad idea on a number of levels.
