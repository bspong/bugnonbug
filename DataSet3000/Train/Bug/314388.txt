firefox crash after uninstalling dragonegg application
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; X11; Linux i686; en) Opera 8.5
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0.7-0.1

I have installed suse 10.0 and included all the plugins available for mozilla. However it wasn't possible to open PDF documents though the adobe plugins were installed twice by different software (acroread and dradonegg). Therefore I have decided to remove the one installed by dragonegg(comes with suse 10.0) but then the firefox and mozilla would crash everytime I open it. The following error was displayed when I tried to open firefox or mozilla  by executing "firefox or mozilla" in shell.

The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 108784 error_code 4 request_code 2 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install all the plugins for mozilla comes with suse 10.0
2.Open any pdf file (it wasn't possible for me)
3.Check the about:plugins and you would see the pdf plugins installed twice
4.Uninstall the dragonegg application to remove plugins installed
5.Try to open firefox or mozilla. (this result in crashing both) 

Actual Results:  
crash

Expected Results:  
open the browser
