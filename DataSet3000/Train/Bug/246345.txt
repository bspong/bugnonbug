when u're on a site (like at mozilla.org) and u want to search for a word on the
site, in google u'd do something like 'download site:mozilla.org'. any way to
make this easier to do when using the search bar so i don't have to type the
'site:mozilla.org' part, assuming i'm already at some page of mozilla.org?

this has to be a general solution, not the keyword thing for a particular
domain/site. and preferably, something we type in the search tab (not the
address tab).

all that needs to be done is capture Ctrl+Enter or Shift+Enter for the search
tab. if google is selected engine, add a " site:"+domain to the google search
string. one keyset does that, other does it and opens results in a new tab.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. search for any word using search bar.
2. to search just that site, add a ' site:thissite.com'
3. press enter

Actual Results:  
google searches the site.

Expected Results:  
that site should be searched without having to enter ' site:thissite.com' and
function this way using Ctrl+Enter or Shift+Enter and show results in a new tab.
