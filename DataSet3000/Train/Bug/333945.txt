On any page I go to, tested on multiple machines, if the page takes more than 8-10 seconds to load all the images it simply stops the loading process.  The throbber continues, FasterFox if installed continues to count, however images are left either broken or with a place holder "trying" to load.  Right clicking on any image and choosing "view image" then hitting back will load more images but again if that takes more than 8-10 seconds it will "forget" again.  Many pages take 2-4 tries.  Note: I suspected our wireless broadband connection might be confusing it however I have tested in IE and Opera as well they have no issues with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site (ie: worldofwarcraft.com)
2. Wait 8-10 seconds for images to load.
3. Observe images that do not load.

Actual Results:  
Some images displayed, others were left with placeholder/broken and throbber continued on.

Expected Results:  
All images display regardless of how long it takes to download them, throbber stops onload.

Done with clean install of latest FF build, using a local router & WAP behind a moterola wireless canopy system for broadband internet access.
