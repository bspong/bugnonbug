Strange Thin Lines Appear to the Left of Links with CSS Hover Attributes

I can't for the life of me figure out exactly what is causing this but this is
definitely a bug in Firefox. I am not alone. Look at this thread on
Webmasterworld: http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum83/4995.htm

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Web Site
2. Roll Over a Link
3. There is no Step 3. Tee-Hee!

Actual Results:  
Thin lines of background color appear to the left of the links, and also of
images that were rolled over during the hover (via an onmouseover().)

Expected Results:  
Not shown the lines.

You have GOT to be kidding! I spent the better part of half an hour searching
through the bug DB and Google for solutions to this problem. When I tried to get
more specific (so I don't get sixty gazillion returns for the word "lines,")
Bugzilla hangs. You guys are nuts if you think that people will spend that much
time trying to find out if a bug has already been reported.
I would not be at all suprised if the bug has already been reported, but, if you
read the thread I reference, you'll see that at least one webmaster didn't
report it because of the Bugzilla stumbling blocks.
I want to code my pages to fix this. I am actually not at all interested in
making Firefox fix this, as millions of copies of the errant version are out
there already.
A very big help would be a way to publish workarounds.
