Os. Fresh install of MDK 10.1 Official.
Firefox 1.0 DL'd on Jan 15.
Followed Install instructions (which are very poor by the way.).
Firefox installs and runs. I look in the terminal window from which I installed
firefox, and I see tons of messages that look like this:
(Gecko:11449): libgnomevfs-CRITICAL **: file gnome-vfs-mime-info.c: line 916
(get_value_real)                     : assertion `!does_string_contain_caps
(mime_type)' failed

I also had firefox crash on me once, and it started the quality agent.

There are many comments I would like to make about firefox on Linux, but you do
not seem to have place to put them.
