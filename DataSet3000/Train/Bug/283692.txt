Expected Results:  
IE, Netscape 4.79 and Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5)
Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 display this just fine (well, there are some
glitches in NS 4.79, but it's a lot better than a blank screen).  Actually,
I find it easiest to read in Lynx (the pages defaults to a rather small
font and doesn't respond well to attempts to grow the font, even after a
refresh).  Those browsers which display the page also show the full source
of the page (more than half is JavaScript and much of what's left is CSS)
rather than just a few DIV tags.
