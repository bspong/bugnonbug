I'm surprised I couldn't find another bug for this (appoligies of I missed it).
 I see no reason that we can move regular bookmarks around but not live
bookmarks.  Specifically:

1) Live bookmarks cannot be drag and dropped to new locations/folders as
bookmarks can in the "Bookmarks" dropdown menu.
2) Likewise, live bookmarks cannot be moved in the "Manage Bookmarks" interface.  

I see absolutely no reason for this.  I have a custom folder for RSS feeds in my
bookmarks tab.  Unfortunately since many web pages require that I add the feed
manually via New Live Bookmark (paste URL), I have no way of adding the live
bookmark to my special RSS folder.  I have to manually edit the bookmarks.html
file in my profile to relocate it.  I should mention that manually cut and
pasting the location of the live bookmark in the html file works PERFECTLY well,
so I see zero reason it can't be done right in the interface like other bookmarks.
