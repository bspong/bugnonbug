This is security issue as the clear cache doesn't delete all the files in cache.

The fact when you hit clear cache it doesn't kill all the files and leaves some
of the files plus the cache.  When the system kills the cache it recreates a new
cache folder so everything is new. On mozilla 1.8 you killed the cache folder
and then recreated it while now in firefox 1.04 you leave the files instead of
completely deleting. There is another problem when you delete the cache folder
you write into the cache trash folder and then clear the cache trash folder. You
then delete the cache folder and then recreate it again. This is adding workload
and takes longer for Firefox to come up when you are killing the cache by 
moving it into the cache tash folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.This is standard delete of the cache folder.
2.The use of undelete program will show that you move it from the cache folder
to cache trash folder and then kill the files. The fach in Internet explorer
show the current date of the folder as create just now.
3.

Actual Results:  
Npyhing different

Expected Results:  
The software should of killed the cache folder and created again as it does in
mozilla 1.8 clear in the option of the cache. You should not write in the cache
trash folder as it is double work on the computer.
