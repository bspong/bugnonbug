firefox is caching after being disabled
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I have disabled caching using about:config several ways, [browser. cache. disk.
enable to false] [browser. cache. memory. capacity to 0] [browser. cache.
memory. enable to false] and finally adding C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\defaults\profile\user.js file to read
user_pref("browser.cache.memory.enable", false);
The user.js file "did" stop the caching for 2 weeks, even though disablig cache
using about:config did not?. It is imparitive that this machine does not cache
due to financial software it runs. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Problem has returned on its own  
2. Removing user.js file prior to the problem coming back
3.

Actual Results:  
I have done everything I have been able to find regarding this issue. The user
has to clear cache using Tools > Options > Privacy > Clear Cache to use the
financial software, else Firefox fills in fields from cache. Clearing the cache
clears the fields.

Expected Results:  
No caching at all. 

Using default theme. Default install, default themes on updates each time. No
additional software used in conjunction with Firefox on office machines.
