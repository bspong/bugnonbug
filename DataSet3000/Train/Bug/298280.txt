The top banner of the above mentioned page (a gif image)+ of few others on the
same site do not appear at all. The same pages appear ok with  Internet
Explorer. When right clicking the image placeholder + Display image, I got the
message that the image cannot be found on the server. However I am 100% sure
that the image is available on the server as I am the author of the site, I have
checked and rechecked and on top of that this problem only happens on my home
pc, on my professional pc, all images are displayed correctly. Can you help me ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.access the url
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The top banners of the site are not displayed at all

Expected Results:  
Display the page correctly

I tried to reinstall an old 56k modem and since then Firefox seems unable to
have the page correctly displayed on the above mentioned site. I deleted Firefox
and reinstall it, but the bug still remains, I do not know what to do now.
Thanks in advance for your support.
