Case 1: SUCCESS
--<div style="display: none"> nested within normal div
--Another div is absolutely position to the bottom of the normal div
--The first div is "unhidden" and the normal div expands. 
--The absolutely positioned bottom div moves with the expantion
--This is correct

Case 2: FAIL
--Nested hidden divs
--Expand the top level hidden div and everything works
--Then expand the next hidden div, the absolutely positioned footer will not
move with the expansion.

Case 3: SUCCESS
--Same as absove except the footer div is relatively positioned. Everything works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to page
2.Click on Buyer Radio
3.Click on Appointments Radio

Actual Results:  
I gasped in horror as my careful layout was scrambled by and immobile footer div.

Expected Results:  
It should have moved the absolutely positioned footer(positioned according to
the bottom of it's parent div) as the parent div expanded.

This is probably relatively non-critical as this bug is mirrored in Internet
Explorer. I would have had to make the footer div relative to accomidate IE anyway.
