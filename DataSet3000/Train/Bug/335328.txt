data from packet BEFORE the GET request is prepended to server response AFTER GET (with embeded webserver)

Hello,

This is a bug report for Firefox 1.5.0.2 (and probably earlier versions too).
The problem occurs when using Firefox with a lowly embedded webserver based on the
popular Lantronix XPort (the TCP/IP engine fits inside the RJ-45 jack itself,
which is great for small embedded instruments).
The Lantronix embedded server device can only handle one connection at a time,
so the browser is running with
network.http.max-connections-per-server = 1
as set by me in about:config.
When a page load is interrupted and another one is started, Firefox mistakenly
takes data from BEFORE the GET request that it issues, and prepends it to the
server response to the GET request.  This corrupts the HTTP/1.1 header and makes
the header visible to the end user.

I captured a small packet dump using Ethereal while Firefox 1.5.0.2 was running;
the file is attached as:

firefox_bug_ethereal_libpcap_file

Sorry, I didn't know which file extension to give it, so I put the info in the filename:
it's a libpcap file.

It would be great if Firefox could recognize that any data coming in from the server
BEFORE the GET request is issued should not be prepended to the server's subsequent
response to the request.  In this, case, the characters corrupt the HTTP/1.1 header
and end up being visible to the end user.

More details follow, including the text content of a packet dump,
followed by the displayed webpage showing the corrupted HTTP header
that is made visible to the end user:

Thanks in advance for any attention that you can give this.
I love using your browser.

Sincerely,

**********
The following is from an Ethereal packet dump using "follow TCP Stream" on the relevant
connection containing the Firefox GET request.

Note that the wayward "tl" characters (from a prior interrupted page load)
occur BEFORE the browser's
	GET /form_entry.html HTTP/1.1
request.  Yet Firefox ends up placing these 2 characters in front of the
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
response from the embedded webserver.

It appears to me that Firefox may be relying on the expected incrementing of the
source port to sort the data, but in this case the embedded webserver always reports
the same source port; the Lantronix XPort only knows one port number, which it uses
for both source and destination port numbers.  In this case, the port number is 80.

If Firefox could recognize that any data coming in from the server
BEFORE the GET request is issued should not be prepended to the server's subsequent
response to the request, this would solve the problem; this seems like it would be
generally useful.
