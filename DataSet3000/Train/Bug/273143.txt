Have default settings for address box & buttons more closely match what common users expect
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1  and Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910

When IE users come to Firefox or regular Mozilla they find the address bar 
(box) is not where they expect. Most users won't know how to change the layout -
 most would not know that you can even change the layout. This results in 
people trying Mozilla then going back to the evil IE. I suggest making 
the "default" layout look more like IE and more like the images I've attached 
to this report - to enhance Mozilla's market share.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be a regular dumb user.
2. Use IE for a long time.
3. Try Firefox or regular Mozilla.
4. Notice how the buttons & address box/bar is not where your eyes or brain 
expects.
5. Dumb Mozilla & go back to IE.
6. We've lost a user.

As a more advanced user it took me a while to figure out how to change the 
layout & to even bother. Most users won't bother. So why not have a layout 
which is more close to what people are used to.

Actual Results:  
Most users: Trying Mozilla & going back to IE.
Advanced users: trying Mozilla & going back to IE for a while until they figure 
out or bother to change the layout settings in Mozilla.

Expected Results:  
Most users: going back to IE unless format is changed.
Advanced users: going back to IE for a while until they figure out or take the 
time to change the layout in Mozilla.
