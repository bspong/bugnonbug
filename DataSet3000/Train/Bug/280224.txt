When I try to load certain web pages, for example, www.azlyrics.com, AOL starts
to sign me in, even though I am not an AOL user. This can happen several times
on one page. On the azlyrics.com page, it started to sign in 3 times. I have
tried to change this in "Options" but don't know where to go to change it. I
have never ever used AOL on this computer. When it prompts me for a username and
password, I just hit cancel and the page continues to load, but this can happen
several times on one page load. The page will not load until I hit cancel on the
AOL signon page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website (example: www.azlyrics.com)
2. 
3.

Actual Results:  
AOL popped up and automatically began signing in as "guest," and then prompted
me for a username and password. I hit cancel, and the page continues to load.
AOL pops up again, and I wait for the prompt and again hit cancel. This happens
3 times before the page finishes loading.

Expected Results:  
AOL should not have popped up. The page should have loaded without it.
