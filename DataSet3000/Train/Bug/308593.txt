here is the thing that bother me since the early versions of firefox.

When you open an url in a new windows or a new tab, and the server is
unreacheable, the timeout generate an error message, but then the adress bar is
left in blank..

practicaly, that means that if your connection crack down between the time you
loaded the page and the time you decided you would click on other link you have
no way to know which page you wanted to open.

I know it sounds silly but it is very very very anoying.
