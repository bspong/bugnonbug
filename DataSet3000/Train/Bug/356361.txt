Firefox leaks memory and intermittedly reloads any page I'm browsing, clearing the screen and freezing for a few seconds, then reloading the page and displaying it from the top.

On kubuntu on multiple configurations firefox will start to gobble up memory 1 to 2 gigs over the space of an hour or two. It intermittedly flashes the screen and hangs a second then reloads the page from the top, although it doesn't seem to request it from the server because entries in form stay put. This starts to happen soon after I open firefox. It's happening right now. Firefox is using over 1gb of memory and I only have one window with 4 tabs open. It seems to be even worse when animated cursors are on, but turning them off doesn't stop the leak.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install kubuntu.
2. Install firefox.
3. Run firefox.

Actual Results:  
Exactly what I wrote above. On both a gateway laptop and a dell d505 laptop.

Expected Results:  
Not leaked memory and not hang every few seconds and reload the page from the top.
