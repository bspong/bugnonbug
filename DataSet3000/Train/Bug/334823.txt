Large windows clipboard adversely affects browser performance (very slow)

If I have a lot (~5MB) of text on the Windows clipboard, using Firefox becomes extremely slow. Note that I was NOT pasting anything into firefox - just using the browser while having a big clipboard was slow. I could select text and watch the selection box slowly paint in (about 5 seconds to highlight a paragraph, for example) and clicking links left the hand cursor active for a similar amount of time, even after I'd moved the mouse away. If I copy just a few bytes into the clipboard, replacing the large content, everything went back to normal (instantaneous).

I found some bugs related to large clipboards, but they discuss copying or pasting. Again, I was just carrying it around.

I did close and re-open Firefox and was able to reproduce this effect with no problem. 

Discussion on the mozillazine forums shows others able to reproduce the problem:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox, then minimize or switch away from it
2. Open a large (5MB) text file with a text editor (I used UltraEdit)
3. Copy the entire contents of the text file to the windows Clipboard (ctrl-C)
4. Switch back to Firefox and try to use it

Actual Results:  
Performance extremely slow as noted in the general comments

Expected Results:  
Simply having a large clipboard should not slow the browser.
