The new feature of right-clicking inside edit boxes in forms, allowing you to 
save the search as a bookmark keywords, radically changes the way users can 
easily save their favorite search-sites.

Mycroft searches will probably become less important. They don't work for 
forms that use HTTP POST instead of GET. They are too complicated to set up 
for non-tech users.

So, I think it would be great if the search box on the toolbar was not 
exclusively dedicated to Google + Mycroft searches. I think user-defined 
searches really should be able to be accessed from that search box as an extra 
search engine.

- There would be ONE "saved-search" concept; 
- There would be TWO ways of setting them up: user-defined by right-clicking 
on fields in forms AND server based pre-prepared Mycroft searches;
- There would be TWO ways of accessing these searches: bookmark keywords (for 
turbo-geeks) AND an engine icon on the toolbar search box (for home users).

I think the current double-concept (one thing is a Mycroft search, another is 
a user-defined search) is un-necessary, un-natural and reduces user options.
