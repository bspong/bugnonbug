Links that would open in new windows can no longer be forced to open in the current tab (same tab) (except through hidden prefs)

In 1.5.0.4, a UI pref existed whereby the user could force [webpage links (within Firefox) that would open in new windows] to open in the current tab.  Alpha 3 effectively removes this.  In Alpha 3, the only relevant pref is the following:

| Open links that would open new windows in:
|  o new windows
|  o new tabs in the most recent window

I feel this is a bad move, since, even though there is a benefit in reducing the number of UI prefs, the removed pref is an important one, to the extent that, IMO, its removal is not justified by the aforementioned benefit.  I feel this pref should be reinstated.

I propose the following as a replacement:

| Open **webpage** links that would open new windows in:
|  o new windows
|  o new tabs
|  o the same tab as the link
| 
| Open links **from other applications** that would open new windows in:
|  o new windows
|  o new tabs in the most recent window

Reproducible: Always
