Firefox goes to http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/whatsnew/ on every invocation
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

I have my home page set to about:blank. Displaying about:config confirms this setting.

I upgraded from Firefox 0.9 to 1.5.0.4.

Now, every time I start Firefox, I am taken to
http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/whatsnew/

which is immediately followed by
http://www.google.com/firefox

When I bring up Tools | Options | General, it says "about:blank" in the edit box.  Hitting the Use Blank button has no effect on the problem.

Per a suggestion on the Support Forum, I created a new profile, which had no effect on the problem.

How do I make Firefox start with a blank page again?

Actual Results:  
http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/whatsnew/ appears in the URL edit box.
I am then taken to that page, and then immediately redirected to

No URL in edit box.  No "automatic" Internet access.  Blank "page" displayed in browser window.
