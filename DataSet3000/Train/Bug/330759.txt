Firefox 1.5.01 prevents Eudora displaying html in messages

Since 7th March incoming messages no longer displayed html content. On same day previously working logons to a datafeed (see below) also failed. Now discovered that by closing down Firefox both problems resolved. Therefore an overnight upgrade of Firefox on 6th/7th altered previously correct settings. MSXML4 has some bearing because by entering http://www.findata.co.nz/xml/CountryList.xml with Firefox we got failure: ""This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.
 
        <DATA title="Country List">""

whereas using IE we got this response:
""<?xml version="1.0" ?> 
- <DATA title="Country List">""



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Firefox running
2.Retrieve e-mail with Eudora 7.0.1.0
3. html content missing

Actual Results:  
Close down Firefox and Eudora displays the same messages in full

Expected Results:  
Should display all content

Should display all content.

Was there an upgrade overnight 6th 7th? No changes were made manually but both Eudora and the datafeed failed. Closing Firefox solves the problem but why?
