Flash files containing audio designated as ‘event’ don’t play properly when multiple files as present on a single page.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0

Web pages containing multiple swf files with audio designated as ‘event’ as 
apposed to ‘streaming’ playback the audio in short bursts or not all. 
Flash ‘streaming’ audio files on the same site playback fine [ 
http://www.soundrangers.com ]. If you continually try to play the same sound 
it will eventually work, playing a little more of the sound each time you try. 
If you reload the page and attempt to play a sounds while the page is still 
loading (while the rest of the swf files are loading in) the sounds will 
generally play correctly. Pages with only a few swf event audio files 
generally work better than pages with many swf event audio files. Every page 
on the site in question works great with all non-Mozilla based browsers. Seems 
like some sort of Flash cache thing to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to; http://www.soundrangers.com/category-results.cfm?
storeid=1&cat_id=0164
2. mouse-over any audio playback file (orange arrows, can't miss them)
3. Notice the inconsistent audio playback.
4. Then check any of the pages in the Sound Effects category, most of these 
contain Flash files with audio set to ‘event’. Compare the results to any of 
the pages in the Music category; these are mostly made using ‘streaming Flash 
files. You will hear the difference. Thanks.
Actual Results:  
Notice the inconsistent audio playback.

Expected Results:  
The audio should playback smooth and consistent like it does with all non-
Mozilla based browsers.
