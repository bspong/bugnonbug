AccessibleText getRangeExtents does not work
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

It appears as though all calls to getRangeExtents on any AccessibleText object in Firefox return x=y=width=height=0.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run gnome-terminal
2. Run the attached standalone python application in an xterm
3. Click on the gnome-terminal window.  Press F11.
4. Run Firefox and click on its window.  Press F11.

Note that due to bug 317475 you should not have Firefox running at step 3.  In addition, you might need to click in Firefox's URL location text area at the top of its window for step 4 to "work".
Actual Results:  
Step 3: You will see what a well-behaved application should do.
Step 4: You will see output like the following with the following
        values: (start=0, end=51, x=0, y=0, width=0, height=0)

Note: You might need to click on the location URL text area at the top 
of the Firefox window - see bug 317475.


Expected Results:  
getRangeExtents should produce values that are real
