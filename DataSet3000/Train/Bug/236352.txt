Firefox  crashes (the process run but the application GUI fails to launch and run) this appears to have some connection to NewsMonster, JRE 1.4.2_03

Installed Firefox and some Extensions (Web Developer 0.61, Dictionary search
0.2, mozilla google toolbar and newsmonster). Running version 1.4.2_03 of JVM, I
can't remember if I had this config of Firefox running with v. 1.4.2_02
(installed all at the same time) - sorry :(

After installing Newsmonster (?and JVM) Firefox failed to launch although
checking the Task Manager shows it running as a process. I've had Newsmonster
running on Firebird various versions without a problem.

The problem was not resolved by restarting the PC nor by removing and
reinstalling Firefox. The only solution I could find was by deleting both
Newsmonster and Firefox. However, there appears to still be an issue - the
buttons on the WebDeveloper toolbar aren't being displayed although the
extension runs and works (accessed via the context/ right mouse key menu).

This has been reproduced on other peoples machines.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox
2. Intall JRE 1.4.2_03
3. Install Newsmonster extension
4. Launch Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox fails to launch.

Expected Results:  
Work in it's usual reliable manner.
