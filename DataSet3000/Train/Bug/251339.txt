Frames Context Menu: duplicate keyboard shortcuts for 'W' and 'F'

Examples:  When right clicking a page with frames, and highlighting the "This
Frame" context menu option, two sets of choices have the same keyboard shortcut
values.  "Sho_w_ Only this Frame" and "Open Frame in New _W_indow" both use the
letter W.  It has no effect that one is capitalized and one is not. Also,
"Bookmark This _F_rame..." amd Save _F_rame As..." both use the letter F.
Another example, the first level right click menu displays "_S_top" and "_S_ave
Page As...", both using the letter S.

For all cases, different letters for each option should be used.  I will note
that there may be other instances of this bug in other context menus, I did not
conduct an exhaustive search.  Also, it may be relevant that the instance of
"_S_ave Page As..." in the FILE menu uses the same letter S there, so if it is
changed, it will need to be changed Globally, as I am sure the rest of the fixes
would need to be.
