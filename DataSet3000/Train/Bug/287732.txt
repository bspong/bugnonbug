I am unable to open new Firefox windows by any means (choosing new window from
the menu, right clicking on a link and asking it to open in a new window,
clicking on links that are supposed to open new windows).

This problem now happens on two of my Macs (both running the latest version of
OS X 10.3).  On my Powerbook it started when I upgraded from the latest
0.9something to 1.0.  On my brand new dual G5 desktop, it just happened today
when I upgraded from 1.0 to 1.0.2.  I first update by simply copying new Firefox
over the old one.  Interestingly, firefox 1.0.2 works fine if I start another
copy (with a brand new profile) directly from the installation disk image and
not copy it to the Applications directory.

In both cases, this bug manifested itself immediatelly after an upgrade.  In the
case of my Powerbook, successive upgrades (to 1.0.1 and 1.0.2) did not fix anything.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to new version of firefox
2. start firefox, and try to open a second window by any means

Actual Results:  
Firefox "thinks" for a while (CPU usage goes up) but a new window never appears

Expected Results:  
New window appears
