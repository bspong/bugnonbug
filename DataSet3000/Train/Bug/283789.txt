Firefox 1.01 doesn't accept cookies from localhost
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

This is a problem I've had with IE6 and now Firefox 1.01. 
I do web development on my home machine, in Windows.  I have an 
apache server with PHP, I'm using ADODB to implement session cookies. 
I'm using something like PHP 4.28, which is a pre-Pear build.. 

Anyhow, I like to connect to localhost:8080.. When I do in Firefox 1.0, 
I can use sessions support to implement a login.. It works fine in 
1.0, but 1.01 denise the cookies and redirects me back to the login 
page I wrote.. The login page I made, basically validates, and throws a 
session cookie on the browser.. When the browser comes back, the cookie 
contains PHPSESSID which keys to a database field and restores the session 
between the server and the client browser.. My experience is that IE6, which 
also has this problem that forefox 1.01 does have now, has 
no problem when the server is running remotely, but when accessing localhost, 
or even 127.0.0.1, the browser whether its IE6 or Firefox 1.01, will deny 
the cookie.. 

I'm thinking it might be a new support for P3P, but I don't know how to diagnose 
if its a lack of P3P.. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start webserver on local machine
2. Write A Login Script that uses PHP sessions, and PHP session cookies
3. Connect to Login script via Firefox 1.01, and try to login 
4. If you cannot obtain a cookie, this is proof of the problem

Actual Results:  
Session is lost because browser cookie is never registered, 
for localhost.. I assume that the behaviour would be different 
if using a remote server, but for localhost it fails to register.. 

Expected Results:  
Retained session.

If this is a new security fix, tell me what I need to do 
to my code to allow for localhost cookies on Firefox 1.01.
