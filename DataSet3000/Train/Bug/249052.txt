Buttons are not rendered (but can be clicked by hunting for where the cursor changes to hand)

All buttons at this site fail to render in Firefox 0.9 and 0.91 under OSX
10.3.4. However, I can hunt around with the mouse until cursor changes to hand
and then click the button.

Buttons render correctly with Firefox 0.9.1 Linux (according to staff of
ThePlanet, who looked into it for me).

They also render correctly on OSX with Mozilla 1.8a1, Safari, and Camino
2004062308 (v0.8). 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit https://orbit.theplanet.com
2. A login form is displayed. The "Submit" button is invisible.
3. After I login, all buttons are invisible.



Expected Results:  
The buttons should be rendered.

Not sure under what component to report this bug; trying to be a good citizen, I
did read instructions, hunt for existing bugs, read descriptions of components.
Is there a separate rendering component? But bug not present in Camino or
Mozilla, so it must be a Firefox bug.
