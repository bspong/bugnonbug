The Places Organizer displays a corrupted list of bookmarks and can be made to throw an assertion after moving a folder of bookmarks into the Bookmarks Toolbar folder.

Seen on both Mac and Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch with a new profile
2. Organize Bookmarks (see screenshot #1)
3. Drag "Firefox and Mozilla Links" into Bookmarks Toolbar folder above it
4. Expand Bookmarks Toolbar folder (see screenshot #2): notice two copies of "Firefox and Mozilla Links"
5. Attempt to delete bottom copy of that folder (see screenshot #3)
Actual Results:  
Places list is out of order, moved folder is duplicated, and program gives an assertion. See screenshots.

Expected Results:  
Moved folder is placed in destination and not still shown in its original location. Destination folder opens properly, not showing half its contents above itself. Nonexistent folder cannot be deleted.
