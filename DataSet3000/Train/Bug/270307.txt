I browse to the URL indicated above. I go to Synths / Ion and click on Quick
Start Manual. A small window pops up, asking me what to do with the file. The OK
button is greyed out.
I select "Open with", then in the drop-down i select "Other". I browse the
filesystem to /usr/bin and select "acroread" then click on Open.
The problem is, after selecting /usr/bin/acroread in the "Open with" option, the
OK button is still greyed out! No matter what i do, it's still grey and
unclickable. This is very frustrating.

Please don't grey out the button anymore. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to indicated URL and click on Quick Start Manual
2.select /usr/bin/acroread
3.

Actual Results:  
The OK button is grey and i cannot open the file in acroread

Expected Results:  
The OK button should be clickable and allow me to open the document in acroread.

The URL that demonstrates this problem is just one among many that show this
behaviour.
Moreover, it's not limited to the example i'm describing (opening PDF files in
acroread) but with pretty much any file type and file handler.

I think, greying out the button is a good idea gone bad. I can see the reasoning
behind it (prevent users from making silly mistakes) but it only takes one bug
like this one to turn a useful feature around into an annoying problem.

Please let the users "make mistakes". Please don't grey out buttons
automatically anymore.
