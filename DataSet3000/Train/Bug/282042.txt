Clicking on a link to a .wav file opens up the file, but Quicktime only plays part of the file.

I am in Firefox 1.0, and am checking my telephone voice mail through Optimum
Voice.  I click on a link to access my account, and then when the new mail
indicator appears, for example right now it says I have a 24 second voice mail.
 When I click on the link to listen to the voicemail, a separate Firefox window
pops up, and the message begins to play with Quicktime.  Unfortunately, the
entire message does not play.  I only hear the first 7-9 seconds and then the
message cuts off.  If I open the same link in IE, another window pops up, and
using Quicktime in the same fashion, the entire .wav file plays properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click on my FF toolbar link to http://www.optonline.net/Home
2. I login to my account with username and password.
3. I am taken to a secure site: 
https://customer.cablevision.com/ov/VMRetrieveM.jsp?
4. The site indicates I have a new voicemail, and the length (in seconds) of the
message.
5. When I click on the link to listen to the message, a new browser window
appears, and Quicktime plays only part of the message.

Actual Results:  
I heard the first few seconds of my voicemail message, and then it stops abruptly.

Expected Results:  
Apparently the tie-in to Quicktime is affected.  When I performed the same steps
in IE, the entire .wav file is downloaded and played through Quicktime without
any problems.  It would be great if Firefox performed the same way.
Thanks for your help.
