In case of long running threads in vBulletein, when you are in threaded mode, cant view the latest posts

Go to the link above. this will take you to the parent post of this thread. 
Now scroll down in the thread scrollbar. To the bottom. There you will see a post by "artofzen". Infact you can choose any of those posts near the bottom. Click on them. The page will load and you will again come to the first thread.

At first I thought it was a bug in vbulleten. But if I middle click on that post, ie to open it in a new tab, the correct post is opened. I saw this for many other threads also. In Internet explorer it works fine. Opera on linux is also okay with it.
