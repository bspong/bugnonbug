Printing works fine with all Mac OS X apps (including Firefox 1.0.x) but with various 1.5 versions of firefox the printing is very VERY slow if I use standard quality on my HP 7310. Slow to the point of many seconds pass between printed lines on the page and a 3 page text document takes 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, I can see that the amount of data being sent to the printer with RC 1.5 is many MANY megabytes of data, often around 170 to 250 kb/sec for many minutes, whereas the 1.0.x firefox and safari send 20 to 40 kb/sec for the same document but a fraction of the total duration.

Also, the print dialog with 1.5 does not include all the options (e.g., two-sided printing, and several others) that 1.0.x and the rest of the mac OS X apps include. Actually, I just deleted then re-installed 1.5 RC1 and the options fixed themselves. But the slow printing is still here with a vengeance!


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Printing is slow and jerky, with large delays waiting for data from the mac for the next line to be printed.


Expected Results:  
Smooth, even paced printing until the document is completed, like all other Mac appls including previous generation (1.0.x) of firefox.
