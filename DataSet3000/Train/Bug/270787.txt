I use customized toolbars: I move the location and google find boxes to the very
top left, navigation icons to the developer bar, and hide the navigation bar
(see screenshot is at http://www.amakuru.net/capture4.png ). I had to reset the
toolbar to default as I couldn't remove a custom toolbar (bug already
referenced). My navigation toolbar stayed hidden but the top location box did
not disappeared. I tried to type stuff in it for a while, to n avail.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.move the location and google find boxes to the top bar (menu bar)
2.hide Navigation bar
3.restore default toolbars (navigation toolbar stays hidden but new location and
find boxes are placed in it)
4.(after restarting i guess) type an address in the top location bar: fail!

Actual Results:  
Location bar doesn't work anymore

Expected Results:  
Removed the location box and others from menu bar
