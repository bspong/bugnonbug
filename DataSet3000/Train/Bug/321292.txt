Intensive image browsing causes various situations in FF

I was browsing a forum which serves a lot of images through Imagevenue and Imageshack. Those image hosters use Javascript to display first a resized image and on a click to display the original size (actually the image is loaded in the original size anyway, only the script makes the resize first).

Now, after hundreds of pictures I had several effects in FF 1.5:
- images are not displayed anymore with sizes larger than the monitor screen size: images larger than the monitor screen size are not shown. Switching the tab to another one and back shows up the image as expected.
- images after not loaded anymore: I had the case (reproduceable) that large images are not loaded anymore (sizes above the monitor screen). Even the function "Show image" showed me an error page that the picture was not found on the server. If the picture is embedded in HTML a broken image is displayed instead. The picture exists on the server for sure. Closing and loading the picture again showed me the picture as expected.
- memory grows significant: the memory usage of FF grows and grows. It went up to 200MB on a machine having 1GB memory. After a while FF dropped down to about 65MB, but still got stuck and slowly when opening new tabs. Only solution: restarting FF

All these effects happen after about 2 hours intensive image browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take about 2 hours time
2. Browse Imageshack or Imagevenue images (best is to take a forum serving images hosted on those services)
3. Open 10 new tabs with viewing the images, close them, open anoterh 10 new ones, close them again, and so on. Reproduce that for the next 2 hours and your browser will run into weird problems. :)

Actual Results:  
- Browser gets slow
- Eats up memory, frees it after a while but still gets stuck
- Does not show images anymore which are larger than the monitor screen size (most important negative effect!)


I know that this bug is surely hard to reproduce. I surfe a lot of images a day and it gets weird, specially when you collect images and do not know anymore if the not shown image is because it is really missing on the server or your browser simply do not show them anymore.
