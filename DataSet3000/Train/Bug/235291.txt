Many connection refused's when using "open in tabs" for a bookmark folder
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When I try to open 23 tabs at once with the "open in tabs" feature for a
bookmark group I get a number of "The connection was refused when attempting to
contact ________" errors.  If I type the name in however, it works just fine. 
This error only started happening with Firefox, and if I choose Open in tabs
again, often I will receive less errors than the first time.  Just a note, it
mostly happens when I first open Firefox and before doing anything else,
immediately choose Open in tabs.  I have tried using two different DNS servers
and I still get this issue.  I am quite certain this is a bug in firefox,
because it doesn't occur in firebird, even when using the exact same bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Click bookmarks
3.Select a folder
4.Choose Open in tabs

Actual Results:  
For some of the bookmarks it said "connection refused when attempting to contact
_______.  Where _______ is the domain name of the bookmarked website.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened them correctly, since there is no DNS error, and firebird
does this without errors of any kind.

Default install, with no plugins that I can recall.  Using Firefox 0.8.  If you
would like any additional information, or would like me to perform any tests, I
would be happy to oblige.
