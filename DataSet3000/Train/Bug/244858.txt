This bears some relationship to the very old bug 17306, which seems to include
discussion from Ben that relates to what is now Firefox.

The Bug: Currently toolbar buttons can text entries can be dragged around the UI
when the Customize... dialog is open. The "Main Menu" (by which I refer to
File|Edit|View...) can also be repositioned as a block. It would be beneficial
though to be able to move individual menus into their own blocks.

This would allow fuller customisation of the UI by users - for instance moving
the "Bookmarks" menu to the "Bookmarks Toolbar" (ala Safari I believe, though
I'm not a Mac user so don't quote me on that).

It might also allow for easier add/removal of menu items than by hacking around
in userContent.css (though I accept that is of more limited appeal).

Possible issues: Inherently powerful, but also offers users the opportunity to
really cock up the UI if they dragged something where they didn't want it. Might
require a "Reset Menu" button to protect them. Usability testing would reveal
this. I would suggest that adding borders around each Menu heading
(File|Edit|Etc...) when in Customise mode would make it obvious that they could
be moved.

I'd welcome the ability to customise the menus.
