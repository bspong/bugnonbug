"File menu" of "Web Browser" oxymoron

At moment, first menu item of Firefox/Mozilla's main menu is called "File". That's of course is oxymoron: Firefox/Mozilla are not used to manage local files.

I'm filing that non-issue now because I have just found good name for that menu item: "Location" (Idea stolen from Konqi). "Page" for some reasons doesn't sound good to me, though would be definitely more user friendly.

That way, I hope Firefox/Mozilla would be more CUI (Common User Interface) /compliant/. (Nobody uses that "CUI" abomination anymore, yet name is Okay for GUI made following common sense.)

* Firefox/Mozilla doesn't work with files. It works with web locations and pages. Both "Page" and "Location" are suitable names, though I think "Location" is more technically correct: few web pages are really pages nowadays. (Or probably "Page" would fit better. It seems that most developers around the web used to "Page" rather than "Location" term.)

* The only file relevant management item found in "File" menu is "Import". But again, it doesn't import web page/location what browser is designed to work with - but user preferences/bookmarks/etc from alternative browsers.

* Tab/Window management commands have to go to "View" or new (well forgotten old) "Windows" menu.

* "Open Location" rename to "Open"

* "Save Page As" rename to "Save As"

* "Save Frame As" - kill it. Anyway Firefox & modern Mozilla do not highlight current frame (as it used to in older times). Only reliable way to access that function is from pop-up menu in frame itself.

* "Open File" can be left here. Not often used yet required function. Cannot think of better name for it nor placement.

* Provide placeholder where extensions can add their own menu items, specific to shown current web page.

* Move/rename "Tools" > "Page Info" to "Location" > "Properties".

* Add menu item for page SSL info, if any. At moment it is accessible directly only thru mouse click on lock icon in location bar. (It is part of "Page Info" dialog).

* Move "Subscribe to This Page" from "Bookmarks" to "Location"/"Page" menu. It belongs here.

I hope with the changes above, the "File" menu would be useful and logical place for all location/page relevant things. The consolidation of the functionality didn't happen since I think few would expect to find web relevant thing in menu called "File".

Reproducible: Always
