Update region.properties URLs
Axel (l10n) noted in bug 318586 comment 1 that region.properties has not been updated with the new mozilla.com stuff (specifically the live bookmarks page). Besides changing to mozilla.com, some of the other URLs could be changed to go directly to their current pages instead of going through a redirect. This is for both the trunk and the 1.8 branch.

Here's a list of updated options that use the new URLs:
---
homePageDefault=http://start.mozilla.com/firefox
^^^ or should this be http://en-US.start.mozilla.com/firefox ?

releaseNotesURL=http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/%S.html

browser.startup.homepage=http://start.mozilla.com/firefox
^^^ or should this be http://en-US.start.mozilla.com/firefox ?

browser.throbber.url=http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/central

startup.homepage_override_url=http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/whatsnew/
^^^ this currently instantly redirects to http://en-US.start.mozilla.com/firefox

searchEnginesURL=https://addons.mozilla.org/search-engines.php

feedLiveBookmarkInfoURL=http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/livebookmarks
^^^ the actual page is livebookmarks.html but it seems livebookmarks (no ext) is what the header menu uses

app.update.url.details=http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/
---

If this is correct, I'll make a patch for these changes and attach it to the bug. Locales that use mozilla.org URLs will need to be updated, too.
