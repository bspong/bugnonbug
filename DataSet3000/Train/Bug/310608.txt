localhost and 127.0.0.1 seem to be proxied by default now
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 

When I enter "http://localhost" or "http://127.0.0.1" in the address line, 
Mozilla goes out to the proxy, even if 127.0.0.1 and/or localhost are 
explicitly put on the exclusion list. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://localhost on address line and press ENTER
2. Add "localhost" to Tools->Options->General->Connection Settings->No Proxy For
3. Type http://localhost on address line and press ENTER

Actual Results:  
Firefox contacts configured proxy server with "GET <my-real-ip-address>" 
request.
If proxy server responds with a page, this page is shown.
If proxy server does not respond (e.g. no proxy server on specified port) 
Firefox displays message "the connection was trefused when attempting to 
contact the proxy server you have configured. Please check your proxy settings 
and try again"

Expected Results:  
Go to 127.0.0.1:80 directly and request the page

This happened in 1.0.6. I upgraded to 1.0.7, but it did not help.
