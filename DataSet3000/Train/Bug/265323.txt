Scrolling up/down with scrollweel mouse/ up-down arrows or scroll bar On
http://slashdot.org the slashdot themes/topics images that appear from
below/above screen are spotted with black and white spots and white lines (see
screenshot).

It looks like mostly pages with .gif images are affected.

Scrolling PgUp/PgDn does not produce any spots.

Right-clicking on any link OR opening a link on affected page in another tab OR
 minimizing and restoring FF OR switching to another tab and back re-draws all
the images and spots&lines disappear. 



Similar (?) bug 201198 produces only white *lines*.
