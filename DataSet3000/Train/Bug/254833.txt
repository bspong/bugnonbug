firefox (0.8 -> 0.92) hang on startup after hours of system-idle
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

After hours of idle time (about 8-12) firefox is started as first application
and nothing happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. do not turn of your computer
2. come back home after x-hours and run firefox as first application
3. usually not more needed
Actual Results:  
The taskmanager reports firefox is running as process (not as application),
consuming 1,4MB main-memory. First the explorer hangs up, then (when started)
any other application, too. Only a restart is possible using the task-manager
(runs in several instances), trying to load another user-profile causes a
complete system hang up. I´m using firefox since v0.8, first the english one,
then the german, i updated to the english 0.92 and to the german one. I got this
"bug" on two complete different systems ONLY when they were running 24h/day.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should start as expected, but just didn´t.

The application-logs just reports "firefox cannot be started, DLL initialising
failed". Dr.Watson dies with any other application and reports nothing, in fact
no monitoring software we tried reports anything. The problem was detected on
two complete different systems using W2K build 2195 Sp4 ONLY when running
24h/day, 7day/week. In fact we checked this on 28 other systems NOT running
24h/day and we never got this error. The reprodrucity-rate of this "bug" should
be more than 50%. It´s a nice one, we are working on it about 6 months.
