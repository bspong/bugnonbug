Table cell expands to wide upon opening browser.  Remaining part of site needs to be scrolled to see.

Upon opening the Sybase website, I noticed that the left table cell expands to 100% of the screen.  There is a scroll bar at the bottom that indicates that there is more content on the page.

There will be times when the page will open up just fine and others when the page will expand to far.  It is also very random.  You can start off on the normal looking homepage, then browse to other pages and come back to the homepage and it will be expanded. 

There is a Flash element in the page and thought that might be the issue...but after testing this on different versions of FireFox and Flash Player it seems to break on the newer versions of FireFox.

FireFox 1.0.7  and FlashPlayer 8.0  = Page works fine
FireFox 1.0.7  and FlashPlayer 9.0.16.0  = Page works fine
FireFox 1.5.0.4  and FlashPlayer 8.0  = Page does not work
FireFox 1.5.0.4  and FlashPlayer 9.0  = Page does not work
FireFox 2.0 beta  and FlashPlayer 9.0  = Page does not work


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. If the page does not open full screen, then hit refresh multipal times
2. Click to another page and then hit the Back button 
3.

Actual Results:  
As mentioned earlier, sometimes it will work and sometimes it will not

Expected Results:  
The browser should display the entire page with out scrolling wide all of the time.
