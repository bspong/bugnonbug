if you close an exsisting Firfox instance (by e.g. pressing the 'X' on Win) and then open Firefox again very fast (~ less than 0,5 sec. in between), e.g. via shortcut, all user defiend settings are erased and the browser is set back to default settings.
i.e. all extensions are set back, as well as all options, including connection settings, homepage, download manager settings, etc.
this is reproduceable every time you do it fast enough and very annoying.
I experienced this issue up from FF v0.8 when I first tried the browser till now (v.1.5).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close an existing single session of FF (no other session should be open).
2. rapidly restart the browser (less than 0,5 sec. in betw.) via shortcut.

Actual Results:  
all user defiend settings are lost and set back to defaults.

Expected Results:  
user defiend settings should be kept.

- 'works' in plain WinXP as well as in SP1 and SP2. havn't tried other OS.
- using AMD Athlon XP 1800, 512MB Ram, Nvidia G-Foce 2 MX, SB Audigy 1, MSI KT3Ultra2.
- system is stable and not OC (passed 8 hours of Prime95 and MemTest). 
- using plain FF v1.5 with only a few extensions installed (AdBlock, NoScript, SpellBound, FlashGot, X Mod).
- large amount of bookmarks present (though I guess that's of no importance).
