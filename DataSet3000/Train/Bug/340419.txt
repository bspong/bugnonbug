Since the last (automated) update i am not able use the search in any way:

The entry field is there and the "magnifying glass"- icon with the options to add search engines. But whenever i enter anything and press enter - nothing happens.

When i try to add a search engine (https://addons.mozilla.org/search-engines.php) the dialogue-popup comes up to confirm whether i want to add the clicked search engine. When i press "ok" nothing happens.

I suppose that maybe during the upload process the pre-existing google search engine was removed. But that would not explain why trying to add search engines is unsuccessfull.










Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
- Starting Search on pressing "enter"
- Add Search engines 

I always used plain umodified Firefox (German Version), so far i never added any search engines but the pre-installed google search.

The search itself has no "Go"-button - but i am not sure if it ever was there - i am used to hit enter on the keyboard.

Off course i can access the search sites manually, but imo the integrated search is a very comfortable feature, so i makred this bug a "Major"
