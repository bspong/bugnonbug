java applet will not load although others of same make will

I've recently found that an online whiteboard-applet
(http://pchat.mine.nu/pchat.php) coded in java-javascript by www.shichan.jp will
not load in Firefox 1.0, although the same, smaller java-javascript app. by the
same developer (link =
http://www.redmoonstudios.com/oekaki/paintBBS.php?xcord=300&ycord=300&axcord=450&aycord=500)
will load, and correctly execute its entire program from application load to
online file saving.

When I try to use the paintchat.nu link, I get as far as the .php room which
contains the applet in its coding (much like the one on the redmoonstudios
server) but instead of loading, it just loads the green boundry-lines for where
the applet should appear, and not the applet itself. I can reproduce this again
and again, and I've tried resetting my browser as-per the trouble shooting guide
on the firefox page, but to no avail.

I dont know if this is a coding/parsing error the browser has with the
paintchat.nu php file itself, or if there is a incompatability with Java1.2.4 on
the OSX version of firefox. Hopefully you can help me solve this issue~ :D

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.load page http://pchat.mine.nu/pchat.php in firefox browser window.
2.You'll see a pull-down menu that says "select a room to it's left. Rooms 1
through 4 are public rooms, and can be entered without a password: these are the
rooms that I can normally access on other browsers.
3. Select any room between 1 and 4 (they all error for me, and they all use the
same applet by shichan.jp)
4. once a room is selected, press the green 'enter' button below it. This will
open a new popup window (filename "index.php" for all rooms, in different root
folders depending on the rooms genre)
5. once the new window appears, you will see the green/lime outline of where the
java applet is supposed to appear, but doesnt.

Actual Results:  
see step #5 above. Every time I repeat this, regardless of the rooms, I cant get
the applet to load. I've tested this in other browsers (IE5+ for OSX [lastest
version], Netscape 7+ for OSX [lat ver.], Safari [lat ver.]) and the applet
loads smoothly, which leads me to believe there is a possibly coding snafu
between the firefox app. & the latest Java release for OSX.

Expected Results:  
the applet should have loaded into a larger version of the one located at the
redmoonstudios.com/oekaki page. The main difference between the two applets is
that the paintchat.nu has a chat-application built into it, so that you can talk
as you doodle on the whiteboard part of the app.

*app. load failure occurs regardless of theme or extensions use. (I've tried
uninstalling all of my extentions and themes, and testing its stability with or
without thier presence.)
*javascript window does <b>not</b> report any errors, logs, or messages of any
kind relating to this matter.
*I tried to load the app. with no other programs running (save for the system)
and that has no effect either.
