Unable to use XUL overlays to modify top-level PrefWindowV dialogs

My extension, TBP 1.2.7.1, uses an XUL overlay referenced via chrome.manifest to
modify the attributes of one of the <prefpane/>s inside <prefwindow
id="BrowserPreferences"/>, located at
chrome://browser/content/preferences/preferences.xul.

In the 20050722 build (and earlier), this worked. In the 20050725 build (up to
the 20050803 build), this no longer works. Bonsai shows nothing obvious that
would explain this breakage, and TBP itself has not changed since then.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a trunk nightly build with PrefWindow V.
2. Download and install TBP 1.2.7.1 (you can find a copy in the URL field).
3. Open the Firefox Preferences dialog.

Actual Results:  
The Tabs prefpane, containing the integrated tab control UI, is available.

Expected Results:  
The Tabs prefpane should have been replaced with the Tabbed Browsing prefpane,
containing additional tab controls provided by TBP.
