site fails to recognise RealPlayer
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc3 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc3 Firefox/1.0.6

I have Firefox 1.06 installed in FC3 (x1), SimplyMepis 3.3 (x1), Ubuntu 5.04
(x2), W2K (x1) and XP (x1).

Until approximately a week ago, all was fine watching video on www.smh.com.au.
Then the site stopped recognising RealPlayer, only WMP. This occured on ALL my
machines running Firefox.

Recently I built a P3 for my daughter, installed Ubuntu, updated to Firefox
1.06, installed RealPlayer - and the site recognised RealPlayer. I have just
checked it this minute and it no longer does. I am certain this is some problem
in recognising RealPlayer in Firefox - though it is likely the problem is at the
internet site, as RealPlayer works fine otherwise. I have contacted friends who
are experiencing the same problem and written to the media site owners IT unit -
though will little assistance in reply.

I am writing this as a bug as I'm not sure where else to report this problem and
feel that as the site is for one of (if not THE) major broadsheet in Australia,
and the problem has only recently occured, this problem will be experienced by
more people than just me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log on to www.smh.com.au
2. click on the 'video' link on the left hand side of the browser window
3. select the play option and only MPlayer starts up - but does not show the video.
4. click on 'video setting' upper right of browser window - only WMP is shown as
an option.

Actual Results:  
I have been unable to watch any video on this site.

Expected Results:  
RealPlayer should have started
I should have the option of choosing RealPlayer to play video.
