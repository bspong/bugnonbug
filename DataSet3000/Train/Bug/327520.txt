My CSS file is in the Additional Info. When using absolute positioning, after a certain point in the page relative to the top of the window (in other words, the toolbars you have effects where it is), images that are links cease to be interactive as links. This can happen in the middle of the image.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make image links above(in the code) a div tag with absolute positioning
2. put line breaks above the image links until the bottoms of the images stop being interactive
3.

Actual Results:  
It appears that when the div positioning overlaps the images, they stop being linked.

Expected Results:  
I expected the images to be linked over the whole image. But it just occurred to me why they aren't.. If the div tag is 'on top' of the img tag, it would steal away the click event. I don't know, maybe there could be a more intuitive behavior for this situation?
