I'm working on a community site at worldofryzom.com and its vBulletin. Browswer
works fine surfing the site, but freezes quite often when working in the
administration section. vBulletin is Javascript based in Frames. 

Firefox freezes meaning no buttons work, tabs can still be cycled but are stuck
on the pages they were at. Quiteing is nescesary and sometimes I need to
ForceQuite the App. 

It varies as to how long i can work before FireFox crashes, but it always does
in the end(eventually). This usually happens in the 'add page' dialog frame.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.I log into the admin panel of vBulletin
2.start working, adding web pages etc.
3.eventually FireFox freezes needing to be quite or forced-quite
3.5. -usually in the 'add page' dialog frame
Actual Results:  
Froze

Expected Results:  
not froze

this may be a javascript issue, when i tried Safari it so far has not had this
problem(more testing needed)
