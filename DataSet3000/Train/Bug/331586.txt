If you create frames and put links in the right secion firefox doesn't load them properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

If you create a page with 2 frames (a left one and a right one) and put a link that is not a full link like <a href="add.asp">Test Me</a> on the right frame it does not load the proper page but instead it will link to the wrong page. (It should link to http://www.example.com/folder1/folder2/add.asp as the add.asp page is in that directory but instead it will link to: http://www.example.com/add.asp (The directory where the frame is located) and this problem only occurs in firefox  (works fine in Internet Explorer and Opera) so really is a Firefox problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create 2 frames (a left one and a right one)
2. Put a file in a sub-directory that you load by clicking in the left side of the frame
3. Put another file in that subdirectory  and load that file too in the right frame but this time from the right page meaning the link should be on the right page and point it to a indirect link: (ex: <a href="test.html">Test</a>)

Actual Results:  
It will go to http://www.example.com/test.html instead of http://www.example.com/folder1/folder2/test.html

Expected Results:  
It should go to http://www.example.com/folder1/folder2/test.html instead of  http://www.example.com/test.html
