Grey boxes appear where pull-down menus are on a page as it loads

When I log into my mail account at http://mail.yahoo.com/, a gray box that is
the size of the pull-down menu when open appears where the box is when the page
loads.  Strangely, it doesn't do it for every single box every time.  When I
move the window or scroll the page, the boxes stay in the same place.  However,
if I click on the pull-down menu, the boxes go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a mail.yahoo.com account
2.Click on "inbox" to the left, usually happens there
3.Rinse and repeat (1 out of 10 tries gets it for me, on average)

Actual Results:  
Got two grey boxes on the fourth try, for the boxes that have the options to
move letters with checked boxes or mark them as spam/read/etc...

Expected Results:  
Not have grey boxes when the page loads.

I tried two or three themes to see if the problem persisted, and it did.  I have
more than one tab open, and the grey box persists there.  I am using litestep,
and if I move the window to a different window, the boxes still reside in the
original desktop.
