firefox in background; mouse hover highlights items and shows tooltips

if another application owns the context, a mouse hover on menu items in firefox's toolbars will highlight those items and show the tooltip information
this becomes annoying when tooltips for example show on the wrong application that's in the foreground but refer to the background (firefox) app

 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
e.g. uses word as an other example application
1. open firefox
2. open word?
3. place word window below any firefox toolbar (say bookmark toolbar)
4. without giving focus to firefox, hover mouse over toolbar items
Actual Results:  
items are highlighted and tooltip for firefox will show

Expected Results:  
application in the background should stay in the background and no items should get the highlighted

try the other way around for better behaviour:
1. open word
2. open firefox
3. place firefox window below any word toolbar
4. without giving focus to firefox, hover mouse over toolbar items

result: nothing happens which is the right behaviour
