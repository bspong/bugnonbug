Folllowing a link to a page with macromedia flash fails to change a url location bar.

When folllowing to a page that has a macromedia flash object embedded, a url
location bar continues to show an old page location. This can probably be
exploited as a security flaw (user will think he is still on original site
whereas he has been redirected). My example is at www.xonix.com/test.html
(follows to test1.html with flash object but url does not change). I have
noticed the behavior on todays Slashdot (Oct 2) - look at a link in the article
on wind generators (5MW project).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page at http://www.xonix.com/test.html
2. follow a link in the page (to http://www.xonix.com/test1.html)

You could probably reproduce with any other two pages where the second one
embeds a flash object.

Actual Results:  
The url bar will still show http://www.xonix.com/test.html when on the new page

Expected Results:  
The url bar should have changed to http://www.xonix.com/test1.html
