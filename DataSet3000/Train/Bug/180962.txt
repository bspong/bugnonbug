insecure form submission warning pops up twice (in the first tab)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.2b) Gecko/20021031 Phoenix/0.4

Enter text in Google's main page INPUT TEXT box (http://www.google.com).
In nightly (Win/binary) builds up to 20021031 hitting enter once got a 
single pop-up warning box.  With builds 20021108,11,14 the pop-up warning 
occurs twice (i.e. ENTER must be hit 3 times in total to submit form.)
- note I unfortunately don't have any of the builds between 
10/31 and 11/08 to test (can do if someone can point me at them.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Phoenix under XP ; surf to http://www.google.com
2. enter search term - e.g. phoenix
3. hit <ENTER> key
4. pop-up form submission warning - hit <ENTER> key - in 20021031 build, done.
5. in 200211nn builds get another popup warning (duplicate)
6. hit <ENTER> again, done.

Actual Results:  
depending upon whether Phoenix version was 20021031 build or
20021108 and later ones gets either normal (single) pop-up 
form submission warning or duplicated warning (respectively.)


Expected Results:  
Expected a single warning pop-up.
