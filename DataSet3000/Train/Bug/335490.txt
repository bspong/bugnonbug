Firefox does not free Memory if you close a Firefox Window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2

If I had opened a couple of Firefox Windows, older Firefox versions have freed memory if I closed one of the Windows. The new Firefox does not free any memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many Firefox Windows with many Tabs with many images in it...
2. open Windows Task-Manager
3. Look at the Menory Usage of Firefox if you close one Firefox window after the other...

Actual Results:  
Memory Usage does not decrease

Expected Results:  
Memory usage should decrease, since you are not able to "go back" to the cached sites anyway!

Something else I run into, is that Firefox becomes really, really slow if you have opend a lot of sites with many and big images. Sometimes firefox needs 1 minute or more of 100% CPU usage to open/close a simple windows with only one image...

But it's not really easy to reproduce, because this happens only if you have visited a lot of pages with images (takes some time...). When I look at the memory usage at that time, firefox uses 300-500 MB (I have 1GB RAM installed), so it does not swap!

Here is where I noticed it last time: http://dtm.de/desktop.php

Perhaps I can find a better way to reproduce it soon!
