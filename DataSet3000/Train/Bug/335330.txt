Firefox prompts for action instead of utilizing plugins

Examples:

http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf
http://freeweb.siol.net/danej/riverIQGame.swf

Clicking on both of the above links prompts me for action instead of opening those files with the respective plugins.

Note the following:

- The plugins are correctly installed and configured when checking about:plugins and Download Actions. The shockwave flash works if it's embedded flash content.

- All things such as clean installations (with complete registry wipes) and new profiles have been tried. Different versions and clean installaions of Acrobat Reader have been tried. It is not an issue with Acrobat.

- The problem does NOT occur with either Firefox 1.0.7 or Bon Echo Alpha on the same system.

- I tested it yesterday with FF 1.5 Beta, and the problem was there too.

- What's worse, I have worked on other Win98 machines with Firefox 1.5 which did not exhibit this problem. Therefore I'm having trouble narrowing down the possible causes or scenarios where this would be happening. Posting in forums has not given any new insight.
