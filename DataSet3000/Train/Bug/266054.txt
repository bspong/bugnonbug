EZboard's ezcodes do not detect selected text when using Firefox.

When I enter text on any ezboard [I have tried this on several], then highlight
the text and press one of the buttons to make the text bold or italic or to
alter the font, normally it should automatically make these changes to the text,
and does this correctly in IE6 and Netscape.

However, in Firefox it does not automatically do so, but instead displays a
dialogue box asking which text I want to alter. This is what it normally does
when you just press the button without selecting any text, which is why I
believe it is related to it being unable to detect selected text.

I downloaded Firefox just last night [10-24] so it is very up to date. I had a
friend who uses Firefox on Windows XP try this as well on another board, and
they experience the same difficulty, so it isn't just me or the operating
system. This is actually a huge problem for me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit an ezboard, open a new topic or open a reply to a post.
2. Type text into the box, then highlight it.
3. Click one of the buttons which applies ezcode - such as [B] for Bold, [I] for
Italics.

Dialogue box displays rather than the effect being applied to the text.
Actual Results:  
It displayed the dialogue box asking me to enter the text I would like to alter.

Expected Results:  
It should have automatically applied the effect, as it does on IE6 or Netscape.

I am using the default theme, I have made no configuration changes since
downloading Firefox less than 24 hours ago.
