For most pages, sending links works fine, but occasionally one will crop up such
as this one which consistently causes Firefox to crash while trying to send a
link. The OS is Windows NT 4.0 Workstation build 1381. The version of Outlook
involved is Outlook 2000 SR-1. This is a corporate workstation, so I can't try
this out with different versions...
