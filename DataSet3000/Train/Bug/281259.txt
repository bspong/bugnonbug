Automatically append "\Firefox\" to whatever custom directory is chosen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

When custom installation directory is chosen, Firefox installs to that directory
directly, instead of appending "\Firefox" to it. This results in installations
to "d:\program files\", pretty much unheard of with other installers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Browse for a custom installation directory, pick one
Actual Results:  
Firefox installs as if it was his own directory

Expected Results:  
Firefox creates its own directory for itself

OK I admit that "expected results" are not obvious. It might be useful to point
out that NSIS and Innosetup (popular free/Free installers) always append their
own directories. MSI does *not* for small applications, although it does pretty
much just that for larger packages (msoffice et al.).

In any case, I personally install all software to d: and Firefox/Thunderbird are
the *only* applications that required me to enter their directory names with
keyboard. I mean it, the only.

This bug wouldn't be a big problem if bug 233746 was fixed - it would be very
much obvious where will FF be installed exactly.

Also note that installing to firefox\firefox\ is harmless (even if a bit ugly,
but who's looking?) while installing to d:\program files\ is simply dangerous.
