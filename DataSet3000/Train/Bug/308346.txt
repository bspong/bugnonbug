On the example page http://blog.thetechgurus.net/index2.html 2 <div> blocks are
floated left together. They are followed by a <div style="clear:both"></div>
which is followed by another <div> block. All blocks in question have background
images. When at 0 height, the <div style="clear:both"></div> does not clear the
floats. By making the div with the clear:both 1px high, it does clear the floats.

By adding clear:both to the css class 'reddivider' it does clear the float
properly also.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. problem originally noticed when css was in a separate include stylesheet
2. placed all css styling in the same file, reduced to minimum number of <div>
blocks.
3. same problem existed.

Actual Results:  
<div style="clear:both"></div> still not clearing floats.

Expected Results:  
<div style="clear:both"></div> should clear the floats without needing a minimum
height. Having to add a minimum height potentially breaks the flow of a webpage
designed to have multiple div blocks stacking on top of each other, for example.
