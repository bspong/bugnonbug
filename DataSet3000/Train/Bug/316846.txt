The preferences window is not responding to user interaction, when loaded for the first time.

When I start up Firefox for the first time after starting the system, and access the Tools > Options dialog, it does not respond to user interaction. The dialog does show up, but I am unable to do anything but close it.
Nothing works, except when I close the options dialog, and restart the dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Windows
2. Start Firefox
3. Start Tools > Options dialog

Actual Results:  
The window freezes, does not interact. I have to close the window and restart it from the tools menu to make it work.

Expected Results:  
The options window should behave normally, like it does after starting it the second time.

Before, I had Firefox 1.0.2 and newer versions installed, and the bug happened on those versions as well
