Reopening the Bookmarks Sidebar after closing it returns you to top of Bookmarks
list, instead of to the folder you were last accessing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks Sidebar.
2. Open a folder at least one screen-height down the list.
3. Click on a Bookmark in that folder.
4. Close the Bookmarks Sidebar.
5. Re-open the Bookmarks Sidebar.

Actual Results:  
You won't be where you were a moment ago -- you'll be back to the top each time.
So you have to manually scroll down to access additional Bookmarks in the same
folder you started in. 

Expected Results:  
Remember where were last time you had the Bookmarks Sidebar open. Which allows
you to access additional Bookmarks in the same folder without scrolling down to
find your spot each time.

No/default theme installed. (I term this a Major Feature because I use and rely
on it constantly during my work day.) 

Great work in general, folks! The tabs are a breath of fresh air. Thank you!
