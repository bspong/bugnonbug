I'm used to my bugs being dups, but I really do search. Maybe this one is new :-).

With Firebird 0.7.1, when I hide Firebird using command-H or option-click, then
when I bring it back to the front by clicking on it in the dock (re-exposing
it), the multi-tab window is completely blank. Anything that redraws it will
make it 'reappear', be it moving another window over it, moving it behind the
dock, or clicking the upper-left button to hide the toolbars. The former two
only redraw the effected portion, why the last one redraws the whole window.

Single-tab windows appear to never be effected by this. FYI, I have it set to
not show the tab bar if there's only one tab.

This behavior is pretty consistent, but not 100%. Sometimes it won't happen, but
usually if I switch around between tabs and try again, it will then occur.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window and load multiple web pages in different tabs.
2. Hide it by command-H or option-clicking off of it
3. Click on it in the dock to reveal it - notice that the window is completely blank
3b. If it didn't go blank, move between tabs a bit and try again. It happens,
90% or the time or so.
4. Click the Toolbar-hide button on the upper left and the window redraws... or
make it redraw some other way
