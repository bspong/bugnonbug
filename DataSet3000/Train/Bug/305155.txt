Can't print any web page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc4 Firefox/1.0.6

When I try to print any web page, everything looks like it goes ok but nothing
goes into the print queue and nothing prints.  The print dialog finds my
printers and the splash screen progress bar shows that it prints. I can print to
a ps file just fine and print preview works as well.

I can print from all other apps (open office, gedit, evolution, etc). 

I am using fedora core 4 and gnome 2.10.
 
I have:
cups 1:1.1.23-15.1
gimp-print ijs driver
epson stylus color 600 printer

I really don't know that this is a Firefox issue but it seems to have started
after I upgraded to mozilla 37:1.7.10-15.1.

I don't know what else to provide.  Any help will be appreciated.
