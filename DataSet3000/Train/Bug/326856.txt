The download actions dialog GUI is poor in many respects.  it lists pointless (as far as I can tell) and possibly conflictory columns for extension and file type, and hides actually relevant mimetype data until you doubleclick.  this leads the user to the confusion of seeing a given file extension in there, and then wondering why it isn't following their defined action when being sent with a different mimetype, for example.  additionally, there is no option for adding a new filetype.  the only way to add a filetype is to actually attempt to download such a file, and then select "do this every time" on the resulting dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preferences dialog and navigate to downloads pane.
2. Open download actions dialog.

Actual Results:  
See multiple actions for various extensions (e.g. MP3), unusual information for others (e.g. RAR), and no obvious way to add a new download action (or restore one you've deleted).

Expected Results:  
See data that reflects the actual action associations (mime type -> action), as well as a button to add a new download action.

there seems to be at least a few questions per day about one of these topics on the mozillazine support forums.
