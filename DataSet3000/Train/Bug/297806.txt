On browsing this url(serendipity blog) CSS doesn't show up while using Microsoft IE it does
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This page (my blog which is in UTF-8 Traditional Chinese) doesn't shows up
correctly. There should be CSS templates loaded. I use serendipity 0.81 and the
developers of serendipity guess it should be problems of mozilla instead of
theirs because in other browser like IE it shows up correctly. Try open this url
in both firefox and IE and you will see exactly what it should be in IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the url specified within this report. (http://starryalley.twbbs.org/blog)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
you will see a blog without CSS template showing up, while IE displays it
correcly with CSS templates.

Expected Results:  
a page which is simply text and hyperlinks.

The server of this problem URL is Ubuntu 5.04 on a AMD XP1800+ x86 machine with
apache and PHP 4.3. This page is powered by serendipity 0.81
(http://www.s9y.org). When using Fedora Core 3 with the same hardware this
problem has never occured. Maybe it has something to do with my OS or other
settings?
