Please see the following URL for an example of this rendering problem.

Independent of window height, the text in the first column of the story is improperly displayed.  The top two pixels or so of each letter in the top line of text in the second column is shown at the bottom of the first column instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/20/news/comics.php
2.View last line of first story column and first line of second column.
3.Text is rendered so that same line is displayed only partially in two different columns, like cut horizontally by a razor.



Expected Results:  
Proper rendering code should make it impossible for a font to be rendered in such a way that it is horizontally split between two columns and the pieces of each glyph moved away from each other.  There is a massive problem with rendering and the javascript in this page I guess 

I am not using the latest Firefox it is true.  Still..
