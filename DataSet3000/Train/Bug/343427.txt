Cookies blocking exceptions do not actually reset when deleted

I deleted a set of cookies from google.com by deleting its folder in the cookiie manager. Firefox then started blocking all cookies from google.com.

I unchecked the box for blocking cookies from domains where were deleted and deleted google from the "exceptions" page underneath, that it was placed on (next to gator). Firefox will still not accept cookies from google.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete a folder in cookie manager with Options/Cookies/Allow sites to set cookies/unless I have removed cookies set my the site checked.
2. Uncheck the above box.
3. Go to allow sites to set cookies/exceptions and delete the relevant entry.

Actual Results:  
Although the entry no longer appears on the exceptions list, Firefox still acts as though it was still there.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should allow that site's cookies, since I told it to stop blocking them by deleting its blocking entry.

No themes. I'm running XP SP2, although Firefox appears to believe it is running under NT. I don't know if that's deliberate on the part of firefox.
