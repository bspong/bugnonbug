Firefox is extremely Slow if I browse images on internet (just with images) no matter the size
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-AR; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I use windows xp service pack 2, and have been using firefox without problems for a long time. I recently installed version 1.5.0.1 and discovered that when browsing images (just images on any tab) firefox gets slow.
The images load at the normal speed of my internet connection but the program itself gets slow, it makes the arrow of my mouse to be slow, and change tabs slowly. It happens on any website, google, wallpapers sites, etc
There is no problem if I load a webpage with a lot of images, but If I want to see JUST THE image, then the program gets slow. For example, I can browse www.gamespot.com or www.gamewallpapers.com, (sites with lots of images) its perfect, BUT if I click on a image to see it bigger and alone in the page THERE IS THE PROBLEM.

I installed firefox in spanish language, my machine is safe, without virus or any other malicious software.
Thanks
