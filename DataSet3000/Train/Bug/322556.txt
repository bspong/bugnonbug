I'm reporting this upstream from gentoo.org. the proble occurred with both our source compiled and the firefox-1.5-r binary. I apologize as I am 99% sure this is a repeat bug. http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117991 that's the bug report for us. 

this problem is directly related to slashdot.org. when slashdot is viewed it
has no icon and any further viewing of any page in that tab the lack of icon's
persist. also Icon's are not properly appearing in address bar this problem is
in firefox 1.5-r4 and previous and firefox-bin 1.5-r1 and previous. only
version 1.5 is affected.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit slashdot.org
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
icon in that tab disappeared and in all pages loaded past slashdot in that tab. also no icon's display in address bar.

Expected Results:  
have Icon's

I may not be able to help much... I had this problem for 2 weeks... and it just disappeared I'm not sure why... it may re-appear however. I'm attaching a .jpeg of the problem.
