Hi,

The Windows XP automatic updated installed "Secure Update for Windows XP XB896424" on 11/10/05.  Since that timeframe I have been having consistency problems with Firefox with returning search results.  For example,  I am using a network application called linkedin (www.linkedin.com).  If I execute a search in the "Find People" tab it will MOST often return a blank search.  I don't recall any problems prior to the installation of XB896424.

My work-a-round is to launch "MS Internet Explorer".

Any help on this one?

Sincerely,
    Trent

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto www.linkedin.com (Sign on if not already cached)
2. Goto tab "Find People"
3. Do a search on any company (i.e:  Oracle)
 

Actual Results:  
A blank page appears (the web browser has finished its work.  No hour glasses arrow indicate system busy state).

Expected Results:  
The search results should return.

Assuming you can reproduce this problem in environment, I would classify this problem as "Major".  

I don't know if others are having this problem or NOT.

My work-a-round is to use MS Internet Explorer.
