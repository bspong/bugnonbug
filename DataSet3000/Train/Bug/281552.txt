"Illegal operation on WrappedNative prototype object" when calling reference to form submit
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

It is often useful to perform actions before the form is submitted. For it to
work in all circumstances, setting onsubmit is not enough as it's not called
when programmatically submitting the form.
The usual way to do this is to keep a reference to the default submit function
in a variable and set submit to the new function, where the old one is called
through the reference.
It works in IE, but the call through the reference fails with an unexpected
exception in Firefox 1.0.

I'm setting the severity to major because it has no workaround and prevents a
feature of ASP.NET 2.0 from working propertly with Firefox. We may have to
disable the feature for Gecko browsers if this is not fixed or if a workaround
is not found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to this page:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<body>
<form id="form1" action="submitcrash.htm" method="get">
	<script type="text/javascript">
	<!--
	var oldSubmit = document.forms["form1"].submit;
	document.forms["form1"].submit = newSubmit;
	
	function newSubmit() {
		alert("Doing something before submitting");
		oldSubmit();
	}
	// -->
	</script>
	<div>
		<input type="button" value="Click me" onclick="this.form.submit()"/>
	</div>
</form>
</body>
</html>

2. Press the button
Actual Results:  
The alert is shown, but the form is not submitted. Instead, I get the following
exception:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Illegal operation on WrappedNative
prototype object"  nsresult: "0x8057000c (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_OP_ON_WN_PROTO)" 
location: "JS frame :: http://localhost/glop/submitcrash.htm :: newSubmit ::
line 12"  data: no]

Expected Results:  
When the button is pressed, an alert should be shown and the form should be
submitted.
