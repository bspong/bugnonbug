Add bookmark appears to hang browser

I have a fairly extensive "Imported IE Favorites" with 30+ groups with multiple
groups being 3-4 levels deep.

When I select Add Bookmarks ..., (ctrl-D), Right-Click->Bookmark This Page, the
application stops responding long enough for me to think that it's hung (I've
restarted Firebird a couple of times before I decided to wait it out and see if
it ever came back).

Eventually, it comes back (approx 60 seconds) and lets me select the boookmark
group - apparently it was filling the drop down box.  Even with my imported
favorites list, it seems like an awful long time to sort through a hundred or so 
entries.

That's problem number 1.

Problem number 2 is if I do it again immediately, it again hangs for 60 seconds.
 Seems like this is a prime candidate for caching the drop down list.
