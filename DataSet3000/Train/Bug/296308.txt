This is so for a long time and it is the same on a friends pc. I suspect it is
due to something in windows XP tablet editon, but I'm not sure. It is no problem
at all on non-WinXP operating systems.

The problem is: when I shut down firefox, it remains in the memory. And it takes
lots of space there. It is also boring when trying to shut down normally. You
can see in the URL (which is a picture) what the exact problem is. Note that
firefox is not running at the moment of the print screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open windows XP (tablet edition?)
2. Start mozilla firefox, open some page, shut it down. Repeat this step enough
times.
3. After closing all windows, use task manager to see how many of them are still
in the memory.

Actual Results:  
Well... http://www.magic4you.nu/forum2/untitled.JPG as I posted for a url. That
is the problem.

Expected Results:  
Ha, going out of my memory of course ;) like all my other programs do.

I'm using a completely standard version of firefox, latest release, everything
normal as it came with the installation.
