Save Page As (complete) mangles ampersand sequences

While this may be related to 181456, I don't think that it is exactly the same.

The Save Page As... [Web Page, complete] function turns a series of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into a series of &Acirc;/#194 characters (the actual
character, not the ampersand entity) separated by spaces.  Consequently the page
looks bad when it is loaded back up in Firefox.

I think that this may be a consequence of an encoding scheme mismatch (the local
filesystem comes up with ISO-8859-1, whereas the W3 website uses UTF-8).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a webpage that has a long sequence of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the URL
provided is a case where I noticed the problem)
2. File -> Save Page As...
3. Choose Web Page, complete as the file type
4. Save the file.
5. Load the file back in the browser and observe the ickyness.

Actual Results:  
The sequence of "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
looks like "A A A A A" (except the Acirc character instead).

Expected Results:  
I don't mind that the save as function loses the &xxx; character sequences when
it saves the file, as long as it saves the correct character.  Ideally though,
any unusual characters should be saved using the &#xxx; sequence to
opportunitythe chance for such errors to occur.

Now this could be a critical bug for two reasons, but I'll let someone else
decide that.
1. It causes data loss (but it does have a workaround, albeit a painful and
tedious one.
2. It should just work - this is not an advanced feature and the impact on users
who see such a bug is fairly negative.
