After importing IE Favorites, the newly-imported shortcuts to local folders show
up in the Bookmarks menu as normal bookmark folders, but when expanded they do
not display all files in that local folder.

This issue is not present in Firefox 1.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to any folder of choice.
2. Create a Favorite item for the currently-displayed folder (Favorites | Add to
Favorites).  This will create a standard Windows shortcut item, a .LNK file, in
your IE Favorites.
3. Start Firefox and import IE Favorites (use File | Import or open the
Bookmarks Manager and then choose File | Import from the Bookmarks Manager window).
4. From the Bookmarks menu, select the imported shortcut to the local folder
created in step 2.  Alternatively, from the Bookmarks Manager window, select the
folder in the folders pane.

Actual Results:  
The submenu that appears after step 4 displays a single, disabled item, labelled
"(Empty)".  In the Bookmarks Manager, no bookmark items are displayed when
selecting the imported local folder in the folders pane.

Expected Results:  
The submenu that appears after step 4 should display a list of all the files in
that local folder as bookmark items; likewise in the Bookmarks Manager window.
