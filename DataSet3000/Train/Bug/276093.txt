Slow form widget rendering - delays when depressing buttons, opening listboxes

Widgets on some forms (see example url) render slow.  There is noticeable delay
when you open a listbox, depress a button, or click & drag the scrollbar in an
opened listbox (only delays just after a click; is fast in dragging thereafter
until you re-click).

It is interesting to note that when I start Macromedia Dreamweaver MX (whether
before or after I start Firefox), the widgets on that page render fast.  When I
close Dreamweaver, they revert to slow.

Another site with forms that act similarly:
http://www.newegg.com

Sites with fast widgets include:
any vBulletin forum forms
any phpBB forum forms
amazon.com
google
Google Translations (which uses unicode like babelfish)
pricegrabber.com

It seems this shows up on very few websites.  I'll post more as I notice them. 
It took me a while to find a second site (newegg) that had the same issue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to example sites
3. Click on form widgets
4. Try opening a language listbox, then click and quickly drag the scrollbar.
Actual Results:  
Slow widgets, hang/delay (I'd guess 150ms) when depressing buttons or opening
listboxes, and when scrolling in the listbox (only delays just after clicking
the scrollbar).  The scrolling in the listbox delays, then jumps to your position.

Expected Results:  
Widgets should render as fast as any other standard Windows widgets.
