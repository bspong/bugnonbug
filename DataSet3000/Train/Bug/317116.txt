Right-clicking a link containing login info (http://xyz:abc@something.com), choosing Open Link in New Tab, and when the confirmation message appears warning you are about to login with username "xyz"...whether you choose OK or Cancel, hitting PageUp/PageDown takes effect in the original page that you opened the link from. This focus issue only occurs when the confirmation message appears. If you've already logged in with that particular username/pw during the session, the confirm prompt doesn't appear and thus the focus issue doesn't "happen".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with a link containing login info, which you HAVEN'T logged in with already
2. Right-click the link and choose Open Link in New Tab
3. When prompted to confirm that you want to login with supplied username, choose OK or Cancel
4. Hit PageUp or PageDown
Actual Results:  
The page where the link originated from will scroll up/down a page, rather than the tab you just opened.

Expected Results:  
The newly opened page should be scrolling up/down.
