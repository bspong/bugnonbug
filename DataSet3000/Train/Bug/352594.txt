Access time to one directory (/data) increases rapidly

Strangely enough, access ('open file') to one directory (/data) increases after starting Firefox. At first, it is similar to other directories. After
some time it takes up to 40 or 50 seconds, both entering and exiting the directory (not opening a file - just opening the directory).
/data does not contain much files (40-50, half of them subdirectories).

No hidden files/backup files etc. Plenty disk space left.
Restarting FF works for a while, then same happens again.

Download manager is empty.

Had the problem with 1.5.0.6, am now testing with 3.0a1, same problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use firefox for a while
2.'Open file'
3.Go to /data



Actual Results:  
Just entering can take up to 40 seconds (or more, probably, but that
is the limit of my patience). Exiting, eg. entering a subdirectory,
is fast (1-2 secs).


Expected Results:  
Same treatment for all directories ;-)
