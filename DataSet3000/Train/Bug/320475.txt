clicking mailto links causes firefox to attempt to open a new process of thunderbird
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

This actually goes both ways.  It seems like I'm either missing a env. setting or there was a major change in the 1.5 branch.  I'm running Firefox 1.5 and Thunderbird 1.5rc1.  When I click on a mailto link in firefox, it should bring up a mail window to type my message.  Right now, it brings up an error saying that Thunderbird is already running and that I need to close thunderbird in order for the message to come up.  This DOES work.

However, I should be able to get a message window without closing Thunderbird.  I've checked my settings in Firefox and Thunderbird.  Nothing seems to indicate a change.

The same problem, other way around: When clicking on a link in Thunderbird, I should get a new tab with the web page loading in the background.  Now, I get the same error.

According to the Firefox tips, I should change the "open links from other applications in..."  I've changed it and get the same behavior.

any help would be greatly appreciated.
