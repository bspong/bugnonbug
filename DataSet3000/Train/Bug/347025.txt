When clicking on a description javascript link the pop up is not the correct shape.

On the URL (supplied) and all others, when I click on a javascript pop up link, the pop up shape is tall and narrow. It used to be the shape required to show what was in the pop up. For instance, on the specific URL supplied, the pop up displays a description of a tv program being broadcast. Before, I used to be able to read the description as it was, er, the 'correct' shape to view it. After the latest upgrade of FireFox it is now too narrow and far too tall to read the description. Half of the description is lost (no wrap around???). I did wonder if it was something in the 'Tools> Options> Pop up size?' menu. But I can find nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load   http://www.uknetguide.co.uk/TV/
2.Click on a TV program description link.

Actual Results:  
Description pop up is always the wrong shape and can not be read, unless right clicking on the pop up and viewing the page source.

Expected Results:  
Pop up used to be a little rectangle that had the tv show name as it's title, the description of the show, duration and the actors names.

Only seemed to 'go wrong' after FireFox asked if I would like to update it. I clicked ok, updated to the latest (??) version, and from then on all pop ups are the 'wrong' shape. Tall and narrow, not the sizeand shape as required by the details within it.
