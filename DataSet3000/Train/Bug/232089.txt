"Create in" in "Add Bookmark" dialog should not persist by default
The "Create in" field in the "Add Bookmark" dialog should not persist by default
between bookmark additions.  It would make sense for it to persist optionally
(e.g., using a "lock" icon), but persisting by default can be confusing and lead
to bookmarks being accidentally misfiled.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. load a page
 2. Bookmarks -> Add to bookmarks...
 3. In "Create in", select something other than "Bookmarks".
 4. load a different page
 5. Bookmarks -> Add to bookmarks...

Actual results:
 5. The folder selected in (3) is shown.

Expected results:
 5. "Bookmarks" should be shown.

Persisting the "Create in" folder is good for some usage patterns and bad for
others.  Two relevant usage patterns (I usually do (A) but I've done (B) a
number of times) are:
 A. [non-persistence is preferred] User occasionally bookmarks into personal
    toolbar or subfolder thereof, but generally bookmarks to main bookmarks
    menu.
 B. [persistence is preferred] User wants to bookmark a number of things into
    the same folder in a single session, and doesn't want to have to pick the
    folder each time.  For example, the user might be browsing through web
    pages for a certain type of product and bookmarking the ones he might be
    interested in.

One solution that would allow both usage patterns is to have a lock icon next to
the "Create in" dropdown.  This would allow for switching between persistence
and non-persistence.  (I'd prefer if the lock defaulted to unlocked
(non-persisting), but I don't feel strongly.  Perhaps it could even switch to
unlocked when the folder is changed, although I'm not sure if that's a good idea.)
