The site at URL "http://www.beppegrillo.it" is an italian blog, which is
frequently updated. I ran Firefox in a computer connected to a network, thru a
firewall which uses Wingate v. 6, on Windows 2000 Server.
The problem is that the page is always displayed from cache with old data even
refresh button is pressed and new content is available.
Actually I solved the problem by accessing the blog with Internet Explorer, then
pushing the refresh button, then new data are loaded.
From that moment onwards, Firefox too shows new data by pressing the refresh button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and go to URL www.beppegrillo.it
2. Push Firefox refresh button
3. Open Internet explorer and go to URL www.beppegrillo.it 
4. Push Internet Explorer refresh button
5. See that the browser shows new data than Firefox.



Expected Results:  
It seems that Firefox do not really send the request of update to Wingate engine
while the refresh button is pressed, so the old data is still showed.
