Select a text in the browser window. Right cligk. We get a menu. I would like to
configure this myself to add some more entries/url's.
When one of the menus is selected, the attached url should be get, with the
selected text appended to the url.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
EG: My web-page contains the following text
" This is ReportId: 830406"

I would like to select the text "830406", right click, then the menu appearing
should show "Reports DB" as one of the menu-item. I should be able to attach a
URL to this menu-item like "http://repdb.rep.com/repid=". When I click on this
menu entry, the above url should be apended with "830406" and the brower should
to a get to the final url "http://repdb.rep.com/repid=830406"
