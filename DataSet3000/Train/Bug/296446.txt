I am using a script to move a toolbar type thing around the page so that a user
can move it out of the way, etc.  Originally I was using position: absolute, and
everything worked fine.  However, I decided that position: fixed would be a
better alternative to absolute because then the toolbar would remain in the same
position during scrolling.  After changing this, the toolbar would still drag,
but on Mac, it would move around a little "floppy"-ish.  It still follows the
general movement of the mouse, but it will at times move around quite a bit
relative to the mouse...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple div or whatever that will have draggable content
2. Make sure that the div has position: fixed
3. Drag the div around
4. Change position to absolute
5. Drag div around

Actual Results:  
The div moves strangely when position = fixed but moves as expected when
position = absolute.

Expected Results:  
Both fixed and absolute would move in the same manner.

I will upload a small sample HTML file that reproduces this problem.  I did not
personally test this on Windows, but a coworker did and he said it works as
expected on Windows with both fixed and absolute.
