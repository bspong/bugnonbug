Default settings (in "Custom" mode) are inconsistent between Firefox and Thunderbird installers; see below

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
A1. Download and install http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8/firefox-1.5.en-US.win32.installer.exe
A2. Accept the license agreement and select "Custom" install
A3. Notice that the installer has the checkbox for "Quality Assurance Program" unchecked and that for [make shortcut] "On my desktop" checked.

B1. Download and install http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/nightly/latest-mozilla1.8/thunderbird-1.5.en-US.win32.installer.exe
B2. Accept the license agreement and select "Custom" install
B3. Notice that Quality Assurance Program is _checked_ and On My Desktop is _unchecked_
Actual Results:  
See above

Expected Results:  
I would expect defaults to be consistent between corresponding builds of Firefox and Thunderbird (e.g., install Talkback by default; install or don't install desktop shortcuts but do it the same way in both cases).

Additional information:
