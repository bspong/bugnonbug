When Firefox is on the second monitor and that monitors vertical alignment is
not the same as first monitor then the bookmarks pop-out secondary menu is not
in sync with the first menu entry. This happens if the secondary menu does not
fit between the monitor lower border and the firs menu entry.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up a secondary monitor with "Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor"
2. drag the monitor so that the top is not aligned with the first monitor
3. start Firefox and move it to the second monitor
4. move/add bookmarks so that the bookmarks does not fit on the screen
5. add a bookmark-folder "Test", with some bookmarks, last on the bookmarks list
6. click on menu "Bookmarks"
7. scroll down to bookmark-folder "test" and then the pop-menu with the
bookmarks that are in the folder pops way above the menu-entry "test"


Actual Results:  
the pop-menu with the bookmarks that are in the folder pops way above the
menu-entry "test"

Expected Results:  
the pop-menu with the bookmarks that are in the folder should pop exactly above
the menu-entry "test"
