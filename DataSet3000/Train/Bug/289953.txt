XHTML Mimetype breaks Save Page as... (Web Page Complete)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050321 Firefox/1.0.2

The option "Web Page Complete" in the "Save Page As..." dialog is unavailable,
if the document is served as application/xhtml+xml (the recommended MIME-type
for XHTML).

Since the current Accept-header favors application/xhtml+xml over text/html,
this breaks even pages that are also available as text/html via content
negotiation. Fortunately (from this point of view) there are hardly any websites
using this MIME-type at the moment, but they probably will become more in
future. Thus considering severity as major.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page which is served as application/xhtml+xml (e.g. the supplied link
above)
2. Try to save the page as "Web Page Complete"
Actual Results:  
Only "XHTML" is available, the options "Web Page Complete" and "Text Only" are
missing.

Expected Results:  
The same options as for documents served as text/html ar available. It should be
saved as *.html for compatibility with older browsers. An additional option to
use *.xhtml would be nice, but might confuse the user. The advanced user could
also set the suffix manually so it might be the best to leave this out.
