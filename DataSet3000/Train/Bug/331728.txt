I downloaded and installed firefox 2.0a1, I don't know how I ever lived
without the close box on the tabs...  That's just awesome, kudos to the
develoers.  I like the RSS subscription support (sorta - see below).  In
general I'm able to do the same daily browsing I did with Firefox
1.5.0.1 in Bon Echo without issue.  Of course I have trouble with
Places, RSS feeds/Live bookmarks (it is alpha though).

Some things to look at (ie feedback) (I haven't dug in to see if these
are already reported bugs or not):

1) Delete, seems like I wasn't able to delete anything in the Place
dialogs.  I think trying to delete even at one point threw an assertion
error.  Sorry I'm not able to duplicate it.  If I come acrossed it
again, I'll try to get duplicatable steps.

2) RSS feeds/Live Bookmarks don't seem to work for some web-sites like
securityfocus.com

3) Having the ability to add an Live Bookmark/RSS feed, from the
righ-click on a link would be AWESOME!

4) Import/Export RSS feeds/Live Bookmarks would be good.  It's would
give me the best way to test a lot of my RSS feeds and how 2.0 will
handle them.  I'd especially like to see OPML files supported.

6) On RSS Feeds/Live Bookmarks, an property that controls how many
articles/entries show in the drop down would be great..  Especialy when
you couple that with Open in Tabs.

That's I think all I have for the moment.

Gerat work and look forward to nightlies with fixes, and any other alphas.
