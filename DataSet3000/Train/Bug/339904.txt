Dear Firefox,
              I am a enthusiastic firefox fan/user. I truly believe in Opensource. I am a security engineer working on Web application security and security testing. 
		I have encountered few problems, when I browse Yahoo using firefox. Firefox, crashes in the middle of browsing. I have found that the bug arises when Firefox calls ntdll.dll.
		Attached are screenshots for the same. You can communicate on my email for further information. I would be very glad to help Firefox team !!!.

       I believe it could be a buffer overflow.
