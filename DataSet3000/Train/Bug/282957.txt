Firefox tries to use the .swf from the same directory, even if the html code
asks for it to be used from the root.

Case details:

There are 2 'menu.swf' files - one in the same directory and one in the root
directory. 

The source reveals that a different 'menu.swf' to that displayed should be used. 

http://www.aciddimensions.com/menu.swf
should be displayed but
http://www.aciddimensions.com/buggyff/menu.swf
is displayed instead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.aciddimensions.com/buggyff/menu.htm
2. wrong .swf is displayed.

Actual Results:  
The file at 
http://www.aciddimensions.com/buggyff/menu.swf
is displayed.

http://www.aciddimensions.com/menu.swf
should have been shown

Clearing the cache, setting cache limit to 0kb, then waiting a few days failed
to solve the problem.

If the file is deleted and cache cleared, nothing appears at all, as below.
