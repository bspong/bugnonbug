The Ameritradeplus site loads properly, but after entering account number and
pin, this message appears:

Unable to authorize access. Please try again.
Contact Ameritrade Plus at 800-888-3999 if you continue to have
difficulty accessing your account. Thank You.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto Ameritradeplus (https://wwws.ameritradeplus.com/)
2.Enter account number
3.Enter PIN
Actual Results:  
Access denied.

Expected Results:  
Access to account should have occurred.

There is no problem accessing Ameritradeplus using Netscape 7.1.  I have
downloaded and installed the latest update of Firefox.  The problem still
exists.  The same problem occurs when attempting to log onto Bank of America. 
This site also loads properly with Netscape 7.1.

Both are secure sites.  The browser is set to accept all cookies.

I thought I had submitted this problem earlier today, but when reviewing today's
submissions, it wasn't there, and I have received no notification about the bug
as has been the case in the past.
