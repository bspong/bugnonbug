When favicon in the location bar disappears drag and drop ceases to work.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

If you drag and drop the location from the location bar onto another tab, and
then open a new tab, the second tab will no longer allow you to drag and drop
that particular URL; in addition, the favicon disappears (if the site had one).

Note: I also noticed this bug while looking for for a site on google.  However,
I don't recall how it was done (whether with tabs or not).  However, it
exhibited the same characteristics where the favicon disappeared and drag and
drop stopped working.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new browser window.
2. Go to any url
3. Open a new tab
4. Drag and drop the location from the first tab to the second tab (using the
icon in the locaton bar).
5. Bring the second tab into focus.
6. Open a third tab.
7. Attempt to drag and drop the location from the second tab (using the icon).

Actual Results:  
1. The favicon is gone (if the site had one); however the drag and drop problem
affects sites that don't have a favicon.  Here's a site without favicons for
reference: http://op3.xfir.net/
2. Drag and drop in the location bar does not work for the second tab.


Note: this is very close to Bug 253542.
Currently, Bug 253542 works for me.

Note: This bug may actually have two separate parts:
1) The disappearing favicon.
2) The drag and drop not working.
