When changing the dialog.title attribute of an XUL-created dialog in a Firefox extension from the javascript onload methods, the internal DOM dialog.title attribute is changed but the on-screen window title isn't updated.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I have created a small extension, Firefox Shared Bookmarks. The problem can be reproduced by installing it (from the attached URL), signing in as "Guest" password "guest", and using the "Download (Choose)..." option.
Actual Results:  
The "Download (Choose)..." dialog box title is initially set in the XUL to "Choose a Bookmark Set".

<dialog id="fsb-datapicker" title="&fsb.pick.title;" onload="init();"

The onload event init() method contacts the remote server and retrieves data. Amongst that is the current quota limit and used bytes. The dialog.title has values appended to it:

var title = document.getElementById('fsb-datapicker-title');
title.setAttribute('title', 'Quota: ' + quotaUsed+ ' used of ' + quotaLimit+ ')' );

This shows the change correctly in the DOM Inspector (chrome://fsb/content/fsb-Pick.xul)

dialog.id: fsb-datapicker
nodeName: title
nodeValue: Choose a Bookmark Set (1672 of 25600)

However, the on-screen window title is not changed. Even if the dialog is dismissed and re-opened DOM Inspector shows the dialog.title is still as above whilst the displayed title is as set in the XUL.

Expected Results:  
The dialog title should reflect the current value of dialog.title.
