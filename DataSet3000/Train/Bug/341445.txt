Mozilla exits when reading Snitz forum messages (sporadic)

When reading messages on a forum run by Snitz Forums (for example, http://www.specracer.com/forums/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=8), Mozilla will sometimes exit. No error message or trap. It happens about 1 in 10 times, but I have not found anything that is the key to reproducing. It doesn't die when in the message list, it only happens when you open a message thread, and then Mozilla will exit (in tabbed mode, all tabs close and the application exits). I can sometimes re-start mozilla, and go to the same message and it will work, other times it will close again. I have never seen Mozilla close like this on any other website. I have seen this at least 10 times recently, but it isn't specific to a single message thread - it has happened on different messages, and I see nothing in the source for that page that would cause Mozilla to exit. I am trying to duplicate on Linux to see if it is OS-specific, but I don't have enough data to be sure it is Windows only.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla
2. Navigate to forum
3. Select the first thread. If you see the message, it hasn't reproduced.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla exits immediately (sometimes). It looks like the page started to paint, but it disappears pretty quickly.

Expected Results:  
The page should have been painted.
