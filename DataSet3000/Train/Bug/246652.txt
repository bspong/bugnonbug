Use bookmark option for Setting Homepage doesnt work properly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040608 Firefox/0.8.0+

In tools--> Options under home page click on "Use Bookmark" button. Now select a
folder from your bookmarks and click ok. Now when one reopens the browser,
firefox tries to open all the bookmars under the folder specified. But it loads
some and fails to load some with an alert. If we change the homepage to some
other page, problem still persists. Restart of browser does not help. But
rebooting the system solves the problem

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto Tools--> Options. From Home Page settings click "Use Bookmark"
2. Select "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder". Click Ok
3. Close the browser and start it again
4. Some links are loaded while others fail to load
5. Set any other page as homepage. Restart the browser
6. Firefox still fails to load the homepage

Actual Results:  
When the browser is started again some of the links from the bookmark load while
others fail with an alert message.

Expected Results:  
The firefox should open with all the tabs loading links properly. If we do not
want the user to specify multiple urls as homepages then the Options UI should
not allow a user to set them in this fashion

Restart of system cures the problem
