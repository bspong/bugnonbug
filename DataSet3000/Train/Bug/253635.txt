Outlook opens second window, then tabs, when links are clicked

Until a few days ago, clicking on links inside emails would first open Firefox
(if not already open) then open tabs (I had it set up for this). I could open
the whole list of links in a NewScientist.com emiailing in a string of tabs.

Then it all changed: Clicking on the first link now opens a Firefox browser
window. Clicking the second link opens a second browser window. Then clicking on
each subsequent link opens tabs as before.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up Firefox to open external links in new tabs.
2. Click on link in external application
3. Click on second link in external application

Actual Results:  
Two browser windows opened.

Expected Results:  
Twoo tabs open in one window.

When this first began to occur I tried uninstalling Firefox and deleting all
references to Ffx in the Registry. Then I created a new Profile. Still the same
issue. There have been no changes to extensions during this time.
