left mouseclick on "view the flight schedule" - the pop up window is way too small to see it!

This was not a problem in your last build. I have built a site for my sister http://www.blaikiehouse.ca and have just had to resize every single pop up window because of this bug in your latest build. Further, the site now looks crap in other browsers, because the windows are naturally far too big.
I have even stopped using Firefox for online purchases because it's too big a hassel as I can't see what I'm looking for (example above) PLEASE repair this bug and email me when you do so i can go fix my sister's web site again.
Many thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with a fixed size pop up window
2. Click on said window
3. Observe that you can only see about a third of the contents of the window.

Actual Results:  
under sized pop up windows. Looks like about a 1:3 ratio. Could a constant be set wrongly?

Expected Results:  
correctly sized pop up windows, matching those in opera, IE etc.

This happens irrespective of site. It is a general problem with the newest iteration of your s/w. Your last build was fine. If you can roll back to the older version, perhaps you can discover the code differences and .. hopefully, the problem.
