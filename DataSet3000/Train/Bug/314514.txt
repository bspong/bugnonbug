cannot login using Firefox / Netgear combination

I cannot login into an user account on www.sipgate.at when using Firefox 1.0.x browsers and Netgear FWG114P router (latest firmware 2.0.18). 

The symptoms are same in WinXP and Linux, the SSL connection hangs after entering login data. Everything works in the same configuration with Konqueror browser or Internet Explorer. The problem is definitely not related to MTU setting as the same issue can be reproduced on 100MBit connection w/o any DSL inbetween.

Now, the funny thing is, if I replace the crappy Netgear FWG114P router with another one, e.g. AVM Fritz Box or Draytek everything works ok, even with Firefox. 

The case is filed at Netgear support but there are just sucking morons screening the developers from customers. What i'd appreciate to hear here is, what is the main difference in how Firefox handles the SSL connection from IE or Konqueror ?

Ahm, an a short remark: I can see quite many SSL packet retransmission of unreassembled packets between the router and PC.
