GTK1, dialog boxes (print, etc.) do not accept keyboard input

When using a Firefox browser (1.5.0.7 and at least some earlier) built from source using GTK1 (as a workaround to the font sizing bug with GTK2, #335551), the print dialog (and others) does not accept keyboard input.  Pointer location detection is fine, and mouse button clicks work, but keyboard input is ignored.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up a browser built with GTK1.
2. use Ctrl-P to bring up the print dialog box.
3. Click in the "number of copies" box.
4. Type digits on the keyboard.

Actual Results:  
Keyboard input, the digits typed on the keyboard, are ignored.

Expected Results:  
Digits typed on the keyboard should be entered into the field in the dialog box.

I don't believe I'm using a non-default theme.  This Firefox 1.5.0.7 browser was compiled from source without any source patches.  I had thought keyboard input to the dialog boxes had worked in earlier Firefox 1.5.0.* browsers, but testing today showed that even 1.5.0.2 ignored keyboard input the same way as 1.5.0.7.  This happens with any HTML page I have tried, including this bug entry page.

It appears as a workaround, one can use the mouse to cut-and-paste the number of pages into the field in the dialog box.  I have not tested this workaround extensively with other dialog boxes and such.

In case it's relevant, I plan to attach my build configuration in a few minutes.  (It seems to be a bit long to put in the main description.)
