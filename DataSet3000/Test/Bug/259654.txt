Any page with a form such as google.com, or slashdot.org's search at the bottom
will cause firefox to crash if I type anything into the input field and press
back on my thinkpad's keyboard.  I'm brought back to the page I was viewing
previously, however the autocomplete menu is still visible for the input field,
if I move the mouse into the field I can select one of the options but if I
click one firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to any website with a form you've used before that will bring up a list
for auto complete.
2.  While the menu is visible I press back on my thinkpad (doesn't seem to occur
using the back button on logitech mice, or alt+back, it has to be the thinkpad
back button.)
3.  Once the previously viewed site loads, click any of the options in the still
visible auto complete menu.

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Menu should just disappear.

will add this information after I submit the form (I don't have it in front of
me, and don't want to fill out the form again after firefox crashes.)
