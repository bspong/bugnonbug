In the page at http://www.candraquatics.com/reptiles/main.htm there is a pop-up
menu that appears when there's a mouseOver on the "Supplies" button. The menu is
designed to hide whenever the mouse is over another object, including the iframe
built into the main page. The menu works properly until you go to a page with a
second iframe built into the first, and then it fails to hide over the new
iframe. The problem does NOT occur in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.candraquatics.com/reptiles/main.htm
2.Hover over the "Supplies" button on the left-hand side to see the pop-up menu
working properly
3.Click on the "Books" button in the pop-up menu
4.Hover over the "Supplies" button to see the problem

Actual Results:  
After a second iframe is loaded (iframe C), the pop-up menu will not hide when
the mouse is over C. The meun does still hide if the mouse is over any image or
iframe B.

Expected Results:  
The pop-up menu should hide properly over iframe B, whether or not there are
other iframes included inside of it.

The same problem occurs in Mozilla 1.7 and on other computers, so there is no
extension problem or specific problem with my software versions.
