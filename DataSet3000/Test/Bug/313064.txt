When I select Real Player as my preferred audio player, I get the window with "open with Quicktime Player (default)" and no other options, then I get the "unsupported transport" in the Quicktime player.

I recently updated my Quicktime software. Since then, when I select Real Player
as my preferred audio player, I get the window with "open with Quicktime Player
(default)" and no other options, then I get the "unsupported transport" in the
Quicktime player. This has happened at the http://www.npr.org and at other sites
offering Real Player. The problem does not arise in Safari or Explorer. NPR sent
me the following solution, but it did not work:

"For Macintosh OS X:
In the Finder, locate the folder where your Web browser downloads its files.
This defaults to the desktop folder. In the list of files, find one that ends
with ".smil," for example: "npr1337.smil." Right-click (or control-click) on the
".smil" file in the Finder, and select "Get Info." In the window that pops up,
click the triangle to the left of the "Open With:" text, so that it points
downward. (If it is already pointing downward, there is no need to click it.)
Click on the drop-down box that says "Adobe GoLive CS (default)" or "QuickTime
Player", and select "RealPlayer." Click "Change All." Restart your Mac."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on any "Listen" button
2. Select "Real Player" as the preferred audio player
Actual Results:  
A dialog box appears asking me what Firefox should do with this file. In the
open with option it says "Quicktime (default)" with no other options.

Expected Results:  
In the "open with" list it should give me the Real Player option, then launch in
Real Player
