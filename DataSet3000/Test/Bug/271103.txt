Not sure if this is a bug or not, but an inactive tab has the ability to
redirect without the user ever knowing. This could be a problem for cases where
someone will have their bank account login opened in one tab, but surf on
another. If for any reason the tab were to redirect (hijacker, etc) to a site
that looks exactly like the bank site, the user may never know about it and end
up going back to the tab to login with all their sensitive information. I think
that a warning, or a focus onto the redirected tab, should be shown to alert the
user to an inactive tab that is redirecting, since the user might not even know
about it, and can become a possible security problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the URL given in a new tab, then go back to another tab and wait 10
seconds, leaving the new tab inactive.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Tab redirects without the user knowing (if not paying attention to the tab of
course).

Expected Results:  
It should alert the user of a redirect, either via a warning dialog or a focus
onto the tab, something to let the user know that inactive tab has changed
without them authorizing it.
