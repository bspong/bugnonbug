URL above not displayed correctly / garbage display for black, as well as white
areas. This starts at about  "How to apt-get the easy way (Synaptic)?"  (2/3
down the page). if i go (in firefox) to a part where the page is garbled (there
are quite a few down the page) , and alt tab to some other program, then when i
alt tab back to firefox again, then  that specific garbled part , may (or may
not)  now  be displayed correctly . Similarly, when i scroll up and down
somewhat (in firefox 1.0.4), then the page may get displayed incorrectly again
on my windows 2000 sp4 system.

On the same machine, Internet Explorer version is 6.0 sp1 displays the page just
fine.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.ubuntuguide.org/ in firefox 1.04 windows 2000 (i'm using sp4)
2.Scroll down the page. Bad display starts roughly at "Q: How to restore the
original icons for Mozilla Thunderbird?" . Most back areas below are bad.
3.You may want to perform various actions, such as : scrolling up and down the
page, switching between apps and back to firefox again, etc and notice how some
parts may become correctly displayed as you do so.

Actual Results:  
As I scroll up and down the page, switching between apps and back to firefox
again, or as i simply open the URL in one tab, well,the page does not display
correctly.

Expected Results:  
It should have displayed black squares showing white text in them, or white
squares showing black text in them.
