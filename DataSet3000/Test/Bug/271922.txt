I have a Powerbook, which supports an external display.  If I run Firefox on the
external display, and have the window sized greater than 1024x768 (the
powerbook's native resolution) then if I send the powerbook to sleep, unplug the
external display, then wake the powerbook up again, the firefox window is
resize, but omly When the powerbook is plugged into the external display, but
only so much as to make the resize handle almost (but not quite) grabbable. 
Most other applications, including Safari, resize fine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Plug in external display.
2. Start Firefox, and move it to the external display if necessary.
3. Enlarge the window so that it is larger (vertically) than the powerbook's
native display.
4. Put the computer to sleep.
5. Unplug the external monitor.
6. Wake the computer up.

Actual Results:  
The window is "migrated" to the powerbook's internal display, and the window
resized, but the resize window "handle" is not quite visible.  There appears to
be no way of resizing the window.

Expected Results:  
The resize window hotspot should be visible/accessible.  (The window is pushed
as far up as it will go.)
