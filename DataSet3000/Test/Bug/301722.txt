Bold text displayed under Firefox Windows build, but not under Linux build
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050722 Firefox/1.0.6

Whenever I try and visit the site above in Firefox under Linux, the text in the
descriptions that matches the search terms (terror) should be in bold. If you
look at the page source you will see this:
"...a counter <b>terror</b>ist team..."
Under Windows it displays as intended, but under Linux it does not.

I have tried Mozilla builds of 1.0.5, 1.0.6 and the Deer Park 2 nightly from the
22nd of July 2005 under Linux and a custom build of 1.0.6, but cannot get the
bold hightlighting. Under Windows I have tried Mozilla builds of 1.0.5 and the
Deer Park 2 nightly from the 22nd of July 2005, and the site displays as intended.

I have tried creating a new profile, but still the same problem occurs. I also
thought this may be caused by a problem with my fonts, but on the page
http://www.alibaabaa.co.uk/php/alibaabaa/article.php?id=30, "Comments From
Visitors" is in bold, and this displays fine on Windows and Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the site listed under Linux
2. Stare in disbelief, as there is no bold highlighting
3. Try and find it in you to visit the same site under Windows
4. And curse at something, as it displays fine

Actual Results:  
The text is not bold

Expected Results:  
The text is bold

N.B.: I am not the crazy fool who runs the site noted, I just help out now and then.
