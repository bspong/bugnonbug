Setting window.innerWidth (js) causes window to be positioned back to the original position

This bug only shows on OS X.

This function is called in the body tag (onload):

function wiggle() {
	window.innerWidth +=1; 
	window.innerWidth -=1;
}

I also tested this issue on FF 1.0.3 on Windoze XP and none of the issues I'm
having on OS X occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://workloft.ch/ueberuns/
2. change the windows position
3. klick any other link on that page

Actual Results:  
The window doesn't stay at the current position. It moves back to where it has
ben originally opened.

Expected Results:  
The window's position should not be influenced by setting window.innerWidth nor
window.innerHeight.


I had to use this hack (i.e. the wiggle()) to circumvent a problem in Firefox
wich has to do with adjusting the height of divs, after content has been loaded
into them (like pictures, that need most time to load).
When content is loaded into .contentHolder and the content contains images,
which load after the page has been rendered, #logoMenu 's height is not adjusted
correctly. One has to resize the window to get FF to adjust the #logoMenu's height.
This problem can be seen, when turning off js, emtpying the cache and loading
