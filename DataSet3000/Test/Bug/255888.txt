When using Firefox Adobe Reader won't load - - plug-in failure

When at the above URL I tried clicking on "2004 Roster in PDF format".  In the
past I've had no problem when I was using IE.  The first time I tried it using
Firefox I was given a message saying that a plug-in was required.  I jumped
through the plug-in hoops (which included removing the existing version of Adobe
Reader from my system - that version was the latest version).  Anyway Adobe
Reader was downloaded and installed and when I try to open that document I get
the following error messages:

Adobe Reader
There was an error while loading the plug-in 'PaperMetaData.api'
The plug-in failed to initialize.

this was followed by another error message:

Acrobat plug-in
This operation is not allowed.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on the above link then click on 
2. 2004 Roster in PDF format
3.

Actual Results:  
I received the error messages described above.

Expected Results:  
It should have opened a PDF document in Adobe Reader


I'm running Windows 98SE

Regarding your "Severity" box below.  From my perspective the problem is MAJOR
but so I guess it all depends on who's perspective this is judged.  Naturally
I'd like to see it fixed ASAP because if it isn't I'm going to have to go back
to using IE and I don't like having to switch back and forth.
