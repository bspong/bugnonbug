If you design bindings and name them with the .xbl extension, they will not load
if .xbl files are associated to an editor in Folders Options.
Nothing shows up where the binding should be, and nothing appears in the DOM.

Please note that if you name them with the .xml extension, it will work even if
.xml files are associated to an editor.

This behavior has been checked on versions XP and NT of Windows, and on FireFox
releases 0.8, 0.9.3, 1PR and 1.0


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Design a xul file that refers to a .xbl binding
2. Associate the .xbl extension to your favorite editor (xmlspy, vim, whatever...)
3. Load the xul file on Fire Fox : the binding content does not appear.


Actual Results:  
The binding content does not appear in the browser, nor does it in the DOM
explorator.

Expected Results:  
The binding content should appear.

If you remove the window association with .xbl files, it works again.
If you leave it but rename your binding file .xml (and its reference too, of
course), it works too.
