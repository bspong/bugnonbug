ff refuses to start on a restricted user-account

installation as administrator is OK. if started on another account (without
admin privileges) ff refuses to start.
20040531 seems to endless restart firefox process (couldn't even kill the process)
20040601 seems to endless restart firefox process (couldn't even kill the process)
20040602 just refuses to start.

After the first start on the restricted account, an incomplete profilefolder can
be found, if I copy the content from the admin-profilefolder to the users
profilefolder, ff can be started as restricted user.

Restricted user means: User is not in the "Power Users" or "Administrators" Group.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new Windows User
2. Remove User from Groups "Poweruser" or "Administrators"
3. Clean install ff (installer- or zip-build) as admin
4. Switch to the created user (or logout admin and logon new user)
5. try to start ff

Actual Results:  
ff refuses to start, or ff (firefox.exe) is restarting endless without ever
showing up.
In both cases ff tries to create the profilefolder and the new profile, but the
profile seems to be incomplete.

Expected Results:  
create a new profile and fire up :-)

I tested this behaviour on two different computers:

First Computer: P4, 1GB RAM, Dualhead (ATI)
Second Computer: P4, 1GB RAM, Dualhead (Matrox)

I used a clean install (removed old profiles) without any plugins or extensions.
