Framed page points to wrong "relative" URL; the frame points to the relative URL of Frameset, not of the framed page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

[Parent] The frames set is: http://www.safroford.com/BuildCarFord.html
[Child] The top frame is: http://www.safroford.com/BuildCarHeader.html
[Child] The bottom frame is:
http://www.autobuybids.com/BYCNYP_Flash.asp?de_id=258&make=Ford

[Child] The bottom frame contains a link in a Flash movie with a relative URL
to: ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

It should take you to:
http://www.autobuybids.com/ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

But it takes you to:
http://www.safroford.com/ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

Which is a broken URL, because the link loses the correct relative path
(http://www.autobuybids.com) for the [Parent] FrameSet's path
(http://www.safroford.com).

I've seen others have reported this bug; however, there detail was not very
good.  This is reproducable, and should be a great example for resolving this
frameset issue.   


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to: http://www.safroford.com/BuildCarFord.html
2. Click "Start Here" in Flash movie 
3. Receive Broken URL

Go to IE and repeat steps for correct outcome. 

Actual Results:  
Receive Broken URL because the relative URL is corrupted. 

Expected Results:  
After clicking "Start Here" you should goto:
http://www.autobuybids.com/ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford



I've rated this major as this effects people accessing email and other
applications that rely on frames in order to perform daily activities.
