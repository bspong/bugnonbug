Since about it has been named "firefox", the browser crashes a lot of times. I
deployed it to companies, and now it is not usable. It crashes for me also ---
it crashes more if you surf around commercial web pages, like www.cib.hu or
www.noklapja.hu. It nearly never crashes on standard small weblogs like
www.hup.hu. It can mean that the crashes are connected with extra capabilities
like flash <-> javascript <-> java or something. However, it renders mozilla
undeployable --- since I am not able to identify more exactly the problem, I did
not report it for months. However, the problem still stands.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install flash player and java (several versions tested)
2. www.cib.hu


Actual Results:  
The browser crashes (disappears), or if the talkback client is enabled, it pops up.


This bug report is the exact "bad example". Im sorry for it, although now I
waited for a long time, and it is critical for me to get rid of these crashes. I
deploy mozilla for around 1000 machines, and now I must drop it.

I tried to compile some versions with and without gtk2, with and without
freetype, etc. However, I did not have the time to find the reasons. Although, I
am very sure that since the version that has been named "firefox" the browser
has some instability.
