Opening some tiff files within Firefox  causes crash[@QuickTimeImage.qtx]
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050204 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050204 Firefox/1.0+

When attempting to open a .tif file *within* the browser, it usually crashes
immedately after the QuickTime plugin fires up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open above image using QT plugin within browser
2. Observe Crash


Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes and takes all the open tabs with it.

Expected Results:  
Firefox shouldn't crash, even if the image is not correctly displayed (and there
appears to be other bugs related to how tiff images are displayed).

Work-around: save tiff document to disk, or use a different tiff viewer than QT.


Might be critical, but not sure if it is a QuickTime or Mozilla bug, and doesn't
appear to happen to every tiff document in existance.    

Searching talkback for quicktimeimage.qtx returns 17 crashes and searching
"tiff" returns 25 crashes (some overlap between the two searches).  This bug
seems to have appeared and disappeared long ago, per Bug 102587, which claims
the latest Quicktime would fix it.  I'm running the latest.  Might be related to
Bug 187421, but doesn't look identical.  I couldn't find any other bugs on this
crash either.
