Installing Firefox creates problem with Ctrl key in Windows XP

Ever since I have installed FireFox, I have sometimes had problems with the
"ctrl"  key.  The problem has been that Windows thinks that I am holding down
the control key, when I am in fact not.  I click on icons on the desktop, and
then multiple ones are selected.  I try restoring a program from the task bar by
clicking it, and nothing happens.  Sometimes on web pages when I use the scroll
button on my mouse, it resizes the text.  Once when loading outlook, a dialog
box came up saying that it detected that the control key was being held down,
and asked if i wanted to load it in safe mode.  Again, Windows thinks that I am
holding down the control key when I am not.  The problem goes away though when I
tap the control key.

I made sure that "sticky keys" were disabled as a part of windows, and it wasn't
enabled.  I then uninstalled FireFox, and the problem went away.  I just
reinstalled it, and the problem reappeared.  I cannot find any specific actions
though that produce the problem.
