Search terms or short names get ridiculous redirects

If I type in a website's name (amazon, hotmail, ebay) without the www or .com,
Firefox goes there or takes me to a related page. Certain sites do not and go to
useless websites and timeout.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type "zwallet" in the address bar 
2. curse out loud
3. type "zwallet.com" in the address bar

Actual Results:  
instead of zwallet.com, I get sent to
http://www.searchenginelinks.co.uk/viewlink-1224.html which usually times out
and inserts it's own advertising frame.
If it doesn't time out, I have to close the ad frame (actually redirect to
http://www.zwallet.com).
Yes, I know it's the first site found on a google search, but that doesn't make
it right.


if I type in "google" I go to http://www.google.com/search?q=%s, which is NOT
the first search result for "google" on google
