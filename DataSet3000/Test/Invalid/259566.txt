F7 message spawns multiple windows if F7 held. New window opens before old one closed.

I noticed this (very) small bug as I have a faulty keyboard with a sticky F7 key.
The caret browsing message appears fine but if F7 is still pressed when the 'No'
button is pressed then the window fails to close before a second window is
spawned.  If F7 is stuck down then new windows will keep on opening for each press.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press F7 to make the Caret Browsing dialog box appear
2. Hold F7 and click NO
3. Repeatedly click NO whilst still holding F7

Actual Results:  
New message appear without old dialog box closing.

Expected Results:  
First dialog box should have closed before second opened.
