People suffering from bug 227260 will be happy to use the performance patch.
Ben has created such patch for the Downloads Manager for 0.8 and included it in
the Release Notes. The extension in 0.9 relnotes is outdated now, it's not
updated for new EM, and it does not cover problems reported in bug 227260
