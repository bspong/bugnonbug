Firefox won't open web sites known to work

Firefox seems unable to load many web pages that IE will load...
On opening the example web page, the "Please check name and try again" dialog
opens, but the url is valid; after trying in IE it works fine.
Switching back and forth from IE to Firefox, the problem goes on for a while
(varies from a couple of minutes to forever).

After cleaning IE and Firefox's cache, the problem is still on; so the 'cached
web page' solution is invalid

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a random web page that gives the mentionned dialog
2.Clear IE and Firefox cache
3.Try it with IE

Actual Results:  
Page loads in IE not in Firefox

Expected Results:  
Should be loading the page
