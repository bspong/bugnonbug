On http://www.macthemes.net, the style sheet defining the text and images that
should appear on the page don't render at all so that the only thing visible in
the boxes that should contain the text is the links in the text and in the
"buttons" to download files.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Visit http://www.macthemes.net without disabling style sheets
Actual Results:  
Incorrect rendering (see screenshot) that renders the site unusable

Expected Results:  
Correct rendering (see screenshot); this was generated by using Style Sheet
Chooser 0.2 to disable stylesheets, then switch back to "Default" -- incorrect
rendering occurs again instantly upon pressing reload button
