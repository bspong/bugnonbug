Firefox/Mozilla Incorrectly Displays the DotNet Edit Module HTML editor
I have captured HTML Pages from the website that best shows the problem...BUT it
seems I can't attach them to this message.

On our website .... the Foxfire & Mozilla Both incorrectly displays the DOTNET
HTML Edit Moduel and the result is an un-usable display .... MS IE workks JUST
FINE .....

I'll Send a seperate Email with the samples of the displays as attachments.
