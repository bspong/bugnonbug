Nested List symbol renders on same line as parent symbol {list}
Steve, this is the bug for the problem I described to you last week. If I have 
the following code:

<UL>
  <LI>
     <UL>
        <LI>blah blah</LI>
     </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>

The layout is this, where o is supposed to be a bullet:

o   o blah blah

Expected to see:

o
    o blah blah

If the parent LI does not have text or an nbsp, then the child bullet ends up on 
the same line.

I'm curious how we know this is a bug.  I didn't think this much rendering
detail 
was specified by html.  Is this only a bug because we are trying to be
compatible 
with some other browser?  4.x?

Lists are block elemetns and should therefore render on a new line, not render 
as if they were inline elements.



------- Additional Comments From jfrancis@netscape.com 2000-05-10 16:44 -------

Ok, but I'm not sure this reasoning applies to nested blocks.  For instance, a 
div will normally start on a new line, but I don't think nested divs are
required 
to make a blank line for each level of nesting.  Also, certain blocks are 
"special".  Table cells are a block, but if you put a block inside one, it
starts 
at the same place as if you put an inline node inside one.

Maybe I'm just blowing smoke, sorry if I am.  If you put a div in an li, it's
not 
going to make a blank line, right?  So how do we know that putting a ul in an li 
is supposed to make a blank line?



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2000-05-11 08:37 -------

true, there are hundreds of examples I could dredge up to support not forcing a 
line a feed, however, an LI in an LI is that rare little gem where we also need 
to take into consideration how it actually renders on the screen and how users 
will expect it to render. 2 bullets on the same line is not a good user 
experience. This needs to render one bullet per line.



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2000-05-11 08:41 -------

oh yes -- one other tidbit, we must also follow standard publishing practices, 
anyone in the publishing industry would faint if they saw multiple list symbols 
on the same line. It's wrong and needs to be fixed.

------- Additional Comments From Chris Waterson 2000-05-21 20:53 -------

The problem is that the nested <ul>'s frame is ending up as the first line in 
the outer <li>'s frame.

So we end up with this:

+<ul>---------------------
| +<li>-------------------
| |   +<ul>---------------
| |   |  +<li>------------
| | o |  | o some text
| |   |  +----------------

Rather than:

+<ul>---------------------
| +<li>-------------------
| |   +<__moz_text>-------
| | o | foo
| |   +-------------------
| |
| |   +<ul>---------------
| |   |  +<li>------------
| |   |  | o some text
| |   |  +----------------

One way to fix this would be to change the frame construction code to detect 
this situation, and insert an empty text frame (or any inline frame, for that 
matter) as the first child.

We'd only do this for an <li> frame if the <li>'s first child was a block 
frame. We'd also need to handle the case where we get unlucky, and the content 
sink truncates the input right before sending us the children of the <li>. To 
deal with this case, we'd unilaterally stuff in an empty inline frame if the 
<li> has *no* first child: presumably, this empty inline frame would be 
coalesced properly with the next inline frame, if one arrived later.

It might even be possible to do the above using pseudo-styles, no? (So this 
would end up just being a change to ua.css?)

Alternatively, we could hack the block frame to detect this case and fix up the 
geometry; however, it seems like embedding per-tag special cases into the 
otherwise agnostic block frame would be a bad thing.

buster: what say you?



------- Additional Comments From Chris Waterson 2000-05-21 21:05 -------

Well, tried hacking with the ":before" selector in ua.css, and unfortunately, 
it seems like it's too clever for me and optimizes away white space. So, I'll 
poke around in nsCSSFrameConstructor a bit...



------- Additional Comments From Chris Waterson 2000-05-22 07:44 -------

I hacked the :before rule a bit more:

  li:before { display: inline; content: "\A0" }

This puts a &nbsp; at the start of every list item. It has two bad effects: 
first, it causes a slight indentation on the first line for each bullet item. 
Second, it forces non-list-item blocks (e.g., <li><p>foo</p></li>) to spill 
onto the next line.

So...this is not a solution. :-(

I think the correct rule is, "a list-item frame shalt not have as its leftmost 
descendant another list-item frame." (By list-item frame, I mean a frame whose 
style has been computed to be "display: list-item".) Now the question is, where 
to put these smarts...

buster is money. He suggested that I look for a way to add padding to the <ul> 
if it appeared as the first child of the <li>. Attached is a rule that does 
just that. I deals with the test case, and a cursory inspection of other 
bulleted lists seems to indicate that it does the right thing.

How does one generally regression test these things?

------- Additional Comments From David Baron 2000-05-22 18:44 -------

Is the solution you really want 'padding-top: 1em', 'padding-top: 0.1px', or
'padding-top: 0.1px;margin-top: 1em'?  Consider what happens when an author adds
a background color to UL.  (I suspect it's the third...)

Also [as a somewhat theoretical side note], should this solution work
(regardless of whether it does in the current layout code)?  According to CSS2
12.6.1, "The :before (:after) marker box participates in the height calculation
of the principal box's first (last) line box. Thus, markers are aligned with the
first and last line of an element's content, even though the marker boxes live
in distinct line boxes. If no first or last line box exists in a principal box,
the marker box establishes its line box alone."  There are two ways to interpret
this quote, since it's not clear whether "first line box" refers to first line
box in the principal box, or first line box in the principal box or one of its
normal flow descendants.  I think the latter is more sensible because of case
where a P element is the first child node of an LI element (I think I had a
discussion with Kipp about this once...). If this second interpretation is
correct, then I think this solution shouldn't work (and there shouldn't be a
CSS2-compliant solution), because the marker should just move down anyway.  (But
if the first interpretation is correct, then the way to fix the bug would be to
change the layout code... but that would break other, more common, cases.)

(Actually, though, that statement is corrected in the CSS2 errata, although I
think the only change is that it clarifies that the alignment is
baseline-alignment and specifies what happens if there are no line boxes.)

I have to say that fixing this bug seems internally inconsistent with just about
everything else about lists...  Also, are multiple bullets on the same line
really worse than bullets with nothing next to them??  (Think about numbers on
the outside list and bullets on the inside.  I might actually want this behavior
sometime...)

Also, don't forget about DIR and MENU in that patch... (and grouping selectors
is nice)

[ Waterson, are you enjoying Layout? ]



------- Additional Comments From Chris Waterson 2000-05-22 18:55 -------

Thank you kindly for your welcome, dbaron.

I tried adding bgcolors to the ULs, and got an ugly result:

+---+--------------+
|o  |              |
|   |o blah        |
+---+--------------+

Instead of:

+------------------+
|o                 |
|  +---------------+
|  |o blah         |
+--+---------------+

With "margin-top: 1em", we collapse the margins, and end up right where we 
began. That puzzles me a bit.



------- Additional Comments From David Baron 2000-05-22 19:01 -------

Yes, I was just about to return to this bug and tell you that the comments about
margin weren't going to work...

I'm thinking more that this isn't a bug... (and that 4.x is buggy).  What's
wrong with:

 o   1. apples
     2. pears
     3. bananas

 o   1. math
     2. physics
     3. chemistry



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2000-05-22 19:26 -------

From a publishing perspective, the markers on the same line are incorrect. And 
you are right, empty bullet or numbered items are incorrect as well, but would 
be nearly impossible to prevent.

2000-05-23 03:02 -------

BTW, per the CSS2 quote given by David, this is going to have to be an html.css
bug fix and not a code-level fix, otherwise we won't be following standards.

Unfortunately, I can't see a simple fix there. Maybe this should be mentioned to
the W3C CSS working group?

(It _could_ be fixed using my selector proposals:
   li:matches( > ul:first-node)::before { content: "\A0"; }
...but that is also non-standard at the moment. And would mess up the marker
box anyway... Arg.)

beppe's right. Two bullet symbols on the same line is absolutely contrary to
what every user and content publisher expects. I don't care *how* we fix it, but
this needs to be fixed if possible before rtm (though I wouldn't hold rtm). Nom.
nsbeta2/3, recc. nsbeta2+ [some lenient date-] with fallthrough to nsbeta3+
[some lenient date-]. Bulleted lists are widely used on the web; nested lists
aren't unusual either; and some of those will be empty.



------- Additional Comments From buster@netscape.com 2000-06-11 15:39 -------

We need to come to a resolution on this.  It is certainly at least a 4xp 
problem, and as such needs to get fixed in a 4xp way in quirks mode.  Chris, if 
you move your fix to the new quirks.css, r=buster.  Having done so, the severity 
goes way down and the rest of the bug can be considered an oppurtunity for 
nsbeta3, pending the results of the research into the CSS spec intent.

I suggest waterson check in the b.c. fix, and work with ian and dbaron to figure 
out what should happen in standard mode.

According to CSS, what we are doing (in strict mode, i.e. lining the list items
up) is correct.

Apparently MacIE5 does it that way, so we do have a precedent.



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2000-06-16 14:08 -------

After reading the response from Tantek, I noted they stated the mac IE5 disolays 
it incorrectly as well -- so why is that the model we would wish to follow?

Regardless, it is incorrect to display two items markers on the same line, and 
needs to be fixed.



------- Additional Comments From David Baron 2000-07-03 16:33 -------

I think you misinterpreted Tantek's comment.  He said that "standard publishers 
are only one of the customers of CSS."  In other words, he said that being 
against standard publishing practice doesn't make it wrong.

I think the alternative is just as much against standard publishing practice -- 
I've never seen an empty bullet introducing a sublist.

Both behaviors are still possible in CSS if we keep the behavior the way it is 
now (without the ua.css hack).  If we change it to automatically insert use up 
the line, then only one is possible and we reduce the power of CSS.

so clue me in here... I can't tell from this discussion if we can make lists

Can we?  If so, why won't we do this?  CSS doesn't say that agents can't have

behavior.  Who loses?

which led me to believe we weren't going to use the style sheet solution.  I'm 
confused about that anyway... can't the ua.css style sheet be overridden?  If 
someone really wants their bullets lined up can't they override ua.css with a 
user stylesheet?

i'm confused about (at least) two things here: first, aren't we always in quirks 
mode?  no one is using strict dtd anymore.  second, you mean we have a different 
ua.css depending on in what mode the document was parsed?



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2001-03-19 07:59 -------

so, I just want to understand, that the CSS Working Group now dictates how HTML 
will be rendered, and that the HTML Working Group does not have the authority to 
dictate how HTML should be rendered. And that the CSS Working Group is no longer 
chartered to provide a mechanism to render the specified style per the HTML 
spec, but rather dictates the style itself.

If you answer yes to any of those, then this will be raised in a joint Working 
Group meeting to resolve charter issues between the two groups.

If you answer no, then this is still a bug and needs to be resolved,

In any event, I am raising this to our chair so he is aware of the 'new' charter 
of the CSS Working Group.



------- Additional Comments From David Baron 2001-03-19 09:52 -------

No, this is the related to the layout quirks mode, not the strict DTD (which was
in the parser).



------- Additional Comments From Marc Attinasi 2001-03-19 10:41 -------

beppe, the CSS wg has no new charter. I do not believe that the CSS wg is trying
to dictate how HTML should be rendered. Rather, it is dictating how CSS should
be rendered. In some cases, there is no way for an HTML rendering to be modeled
perfectly in CSS, and in some cases there is no desire to mirror an HTML
rendering in CSS. But anyway, CSS is in no way indicating how HTML should be
rendered. As for the CSS being chartered to provide a rendering per the HTML
spec, that is unclear to me: my understanding is that the CSS wg is not bound to
support any markup languages's rendering model exactly (though in practice it
may choose to).

CSS working group charters and attitudes aside, Mozilla, as an HTML and CSS
browser, can choose to render HTML elements using CSS or not, particularly in
QuirksMode. So the issue here is no necessarily with our adherance to CSS, but
instead with how we render HTML. Take, for example, the fact that we implement
HR and BR which cannot be directly modeled in CSS...

btw: is there a link to the discussion you cited in the HTML group wrt how empty
list items are to be formatted?



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2001-03-19 11:00 -------

yes, look at the response I cited on 3/15 -- that is the official response from 
the HTML Working Group on how list items should be rendered and then look at 
Ian's response to that message: stating that HTML WG cannot specify how HTML 
elements are rendered, this is being discussed in the HTML Working Group phone 
conference this Wednesday. I'm troubled by the fact that Ian believes that the 
CSS Working Group has authority on dictating how HTML elements are rendered, 
rather than providing a mechanism to render -- there is a very big difference 
between the two.



------- Additional Comments From Marc Attinasi 2001-03-19 11:18 -------

I didn't realize that those two links were all that we have to go on. Just to be
fair, Ian's comment is not that the HTML wg cannot dictate how HTML is to be
rendered, rather he stated that the HTML wg cannot dictate how CSS is to be
rendered:

"The HTML working group does not have the authority to specify how CSS should
lay out."

It is a matter of the CSS-person thinking of the CSS rules, and the HTML-person
thinking of the HTML rules (and the two rules conflict).

I think one misunderstanding is that CSS is markup language agnostic (more or
less). In other words, it does not specifically care about HTML and the specific
rendering rules of HTML. Instead, it uses generic properties that /sometimes/
map well to intrinsic HTML element presentational semantics. I hope that the
telecon on Wednesday is fruitful (although I fear that the attutudes have
possibly soured somewhat). Maybe the discussion should start with a
cross-group-hug :)



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2001-03-19 12:40 -------

I have to disagree with you Marc, when it is stated that the "HTML working group 
has no authority to specify ..." that is a pretty clear indication that teh 
CSS working group is under the belief that rendering requirements as specified 
by the HTML/XTHML specifications do not or will not be honored -- at that is 
wrong.

And as it is stated in this bug, nested block elements will not render like 
this:

block element 1
block element 2

but rather be rendered like this
block element 1  block element 2

which is also wrong

and lists are block elements, it just so happens that nested elements are also 
to be indented

Taking this bug while we try to resolve the HTML and CSS divergence.



------- Additional Comments From Marc Attinasi 2001-03-20 22:40 -------

A summary point: In quirks mode we put the nested list item on its own line, 
which is what the HTML wg thinks should happen. In standard mode, we follow the 
CSS rules for positioning the blocks, and as such the nested list item ends up 
on the same line. 

Before I can resolve this bug I need to understand two things: 1) why is the 
HTML specification requiring a specific rendering (it is a structural markup 
language, not a visual rendering language), and 2) is it reasonable for Mozilla 
to favor CSS-specified rendering in standard mode (over and HTML-specified 
rendering).



------- Additional Comments From beppe@netscape.com 2001-03-21 07:11 -------

MArc, as for the specific rendering requirements, please remember that HTML has 
been around a lng time before CSS came to be, with that in mind there are 
certain expectations on how elements should be rendered. As an example, it is 
expected that the address block be smaller and italic, the H1 element be larger 
and bold, TH to be centered and bold, TD to be normal and flush left, etc. -- 
those conventions did not derive from CSS, they derived from pulling acceptable 
publishing standards and melding them into the HTML spec. Whether people like 
the idea that the HTML spec and/or working group are specifying rendering is an 
issue that will need to be accepted -- that will happen due to many reasons, as 
will other specs specifying how objects should be rendered or handled by user 
agents.

Should our user agent render in respect to legacy documents and acceptable 
publishing standards -- yes it should. Remember, there is a large audience out 
there that has set the standard on how objects are expected to be rendered. In 
addition, CSS is not everywhere there are literally thousands of pages out there 
that do not utilize CSS and they probably never will, no matter how zealous 
anyone is about trying to force people to use CSS.



------- Additional Comments From Marc Attinasi 2001-03-21 10:07 -------

Beppe, we handle the legacy case correctly already. The entire discussion should
be restricted to non-Quirks mode rendering, because in Quirks mode (i.e. legacy
documents) we do what you want anyway already.

I have comments on some of what you said specifically:

>As an example, it is expected that the address block be smaller and italic, the
>H1 element be larger and bold

This is not correct. The way that the H1 (or any other element) is rendered is
specified by the stylistic properties for that element. In our case, that means
the HTML attributes and the CSS style properties. If the style properties for
the H1 say make it inline, small and red, then that is what we do. By default,
we provide style rules that make the H1 large and bold, but there is nothing in
the HTML 4 spec saying how an H1 has to be rendered. In fact, section 7.5.5 of
the HTML 4.01 spec says:

"There are six levels of headings in HTML with H1 as the most important and H6
as the least. Visual browsers usually render more important headings in larger
fonts than less important ones."

This language makes it clear that the rendering of elements is NOT specified at
all, in fact it isn't even a suggestion here, just an anecdotal note.

Separation of content and style is a key goal of the HTML group if I remember
correctly, and specifying rendering semantics is completly contrary to that.

>Whether people like the idea that the HTML spec and/or working group are
>specifying rendering is an issue that will need to be accepted...

I disagree, at least partially. I am not a member of the HTML wg, so I do not
know what the intention of the group is, but in the modern era, HTML (and XHTML)
is a markup language, not a rendering semantic. From my reading of the HTML 4.01
specification, it is clear that one of the goals of HTML is to get away from
specifying rendering. Take for example this quote from section 2.4.1

"2.4.1 Separate structure and presentation
HTML has its roots in SGML which has always been a language for the
specification of structural markup. As HTML matures, more and more of its
presentational elements and attributes are being replaced by other mechanisms,
in particular style sheets. Experience has shown that separating the structure
of a document from its presentational aspects reduces the cost of serving a wide
range of platforms, media, etc., and facilitates document revisions."

So I am not fully convinced of your arguments for why the HTML group is
specifying rendering semantics. More importantly, I do not really see how this
is important to Mozilla's STANDARD MODE rendering (remember, the legacy case is
already covered in Mozilla). In other words, even if the HTML specifications of
the future do intend to assert rendering semantics (in apparent contradiction to
previous stated goals and directions), we have to choose which standard we want
to conform to, because we cannot conform to both when they conflict.

Marc, if you read again what I stated you will note that I never said that the 
HTML spec dictates the rendering -- what I did say was: "As an example, it is 
EXPECTED ..." expectation is clearly different than DICTATE. Please don't take 
my comments out of context. What is at issue here, is what the user EXPECTS to 
see based on PAST usage. A user will expect to see their web page render as it 
rendered before, and that should be our concern. That is the point here Marc, 
which is what I have been trying to say for the last 10 months, nested bullets 
are not expected behavior, that is not the precedent, that is not what users see 
in past browsers, that is not what people see in IE, hence we are broken.

And, as I further noted in the previous sentence: "with that in mind there are 
certain EXPECTATIONS on how elements should be rendered" and the rendering of 
the nested lists clearly violates the "least surprise rule" Expected behavior, 
based on prior usage does matter, what the stylistic rules applied to the 
element is what we are putting on the markup via the CSS -- where else is the 
style rules coming from? The small, red, blinking whatever is coming from our 
CSS rules -- isn't it? Or are those rules coming from someplace else that I have 
not been made known about?

You're preaching to the choir about separartion of content, markup and style -- 
remember I've been in the SGML world since the mid-80s. I was evangelizing that 
since then. But, what does that have to do with what we are talking about? This 
discussion has to do with user expectation. Who owns "style" is just a pissing 
in the wind contest and one that shouldn't have even been raised.

The intention of the working group is to provide a markup language that can be 
used for 1. web authoring, 2. hand-held devices, 3. other devices/view ports 
that can and would prefer to use that markup language. As I stated above, the 
precedent has been set on user expectation and it violates the "least surprise 
rule." In addition, as a user, how in the heck would I know the difference 
between standard mode and quirks mode, more importantly why should I know, or 
why should I care -- what I would know is that the mozilla browser and the 
Netscape browser are broken, they do not render my page as 4.x or IE. And if I 
have any publishing background, it absolutely violates any publishing rule out 
there, double bullets on the same line?

As I said before -- I give up, if you all want to render double bullets on the 
same line, so be it. However, when it comes time to build templates, when 
customers complain, then you can deal with them.

Beppe, I don't know how to respond without taking your comments out of context
to some extent. The context is always here anyway, in the bug history. However,
I do not mean to _misconstrue_ your comments and for that I apologize. Clearly
what I read and what you wrote were different (regarding expectations vs.
dictates of the specification), and for that I am sorry.

You wrote (please see comment 2001-03-21 16:34 for full context):

"What is at issue here, is what the user EXPECTS to see based on PAST usage. A
user will expect to see their web page render as it rendered before, and that
should be our concern. That is the point here Marc, which is what I have been
trying to say for the last 10 months[...]"

and

"...-- what I would know is that the mozilla browser and the Netscape browser
are broken, they do not render my page as 4.x or IE."

I cannot agree with this at all. If we base all of our decisions on PAST usage
and what the user has seen before then we will never progress from the legacy of
past browsers. And, just because we do not render something as Nav 4.x or IE do
does not mean that we are broken. However, bear in mind that we do try very
*very* hard to handle backward compatibility issues, and that is that Quirks
Mode is all about. In this case, as I have said before, we handle the legacy,
backward compatibility case correcly: in older documents, those with doctypes
trigger NavQuirksMode, we emulate what past browsers did. In new documents,
however, we prefer to render according to the published standards and do NOT try
to emulate past browser behaviors (unless of course they are in accordance with
the standards that we support). We are trying to make a compromise here: in
older documents we render as legacy browsers did, in new documents we adhere to
the published standards and make no attempt to emulate legacy browsers. This is
how we handle many case, from table style propagation to line-height
calculations to form control sizing. It is the best we can do when the legacy
behavior and the published specifications are at odds.

Since you may be reconsidering this bug's urgency, I'd like to restate the
currnent situation:

A) we render according to CSS2 spec in StandardMode documents
B) we render like IE and Nav in QuirkMode documents

The remaining contention seems to be about whether or not we should disregard
the CSS2 specification in standard mode and *always* use our quirk mode
rendering. This is an issue for the HTML and CSS working groups. At such a time
as the CSS specification is ammended to reflect the position that empty list
items should not take up their own line, if that should ever pass, we will have
a bug to fix. For now I think we have a good comprimise: we act like legacy
browsers in Quirks mode, and we follow the standards in StandardMode.
