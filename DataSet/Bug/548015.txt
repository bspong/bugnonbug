memory leak of 1.9.0 on Mac at unit tests
The leak started from:
> MacOSX Darwin 8.11.1 bm-xserve20 dep unit test
> Started 2010/02/12 19:51, finished 2010/02/12 21:19

but the previous build cycle doesn't have this problem:
> MacOSX Darwin 8.11.1 bm-xserve20 dep unit test
> Started 2010/02/12 10:51, finished 2010/02/12 11:53

looks like there are no check-ins between these two cycles.

On most cases, this is displayed as
> mochitest
> 45378/13/1157
> chrome
> 558/63/28
on tinderbox.
