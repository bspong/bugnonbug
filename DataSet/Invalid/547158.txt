adding exceptions for self-signed SSL certs fails
After installing FoxyProxy (the attached extension), I cannot add exceptions for any self-signed certs. Here are some sample sites:

https://electricmonk.nl/
https://www.renfe.es/
https://btmusic.eu/

The "Confirm Security Exception" button is never enabled. Exception in the JS console is:

Error: Attempted to connect to a site with a bad certificate in the add exception dialog. This results in a (mostly harmless) exception being thrown. Logged for information purposes only: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIXMLHttpRequest.send]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://pippki/content/exceptionDialog.js :: checkCert :: line 167"  data: no]

From IRC tonight:

(11:08:53 PM) ericjung: looks like the exact error at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/pki/resources/content/exceptionDialog.js?force=1#162
(11:09:12 PM) ericjung: so why can't the user continue?
(11:10:44 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: because getting the cert failed
(11:11:11 PM) gavin: because we didn't get into http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/pki/resources/content/exceptionDialog.js?force=1#180 for some reason
(11:11:50 PM) bz_sleep: oh, hmm
(11:12:14 PM) ericjung: this happens even if all proxying disabled. any vague ideas what might cause this? i'm at a loss.
(11:12:29 PM) bz_sleep: you get to line 180, right?
(11:12:35 PM) bz_sleep: is req.channel non-null?
(11:12:41 PM) bz_sleep: is req.channel.securityInfo non-null?
(11:13:13 PM) bz_sleep: my money is on req.channel being null
(11:13:17 PM) bz_sleep: given the error....
(11:13:31 PM) ericjung: hm
(11:13:52 PM) ericjung: damn, gina, this is HARD
(11:13:59 PM) gavin: the error is expected
(11:14:14 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: _an_ error, or this particular error?
(11:14:32 PM) gavin: this particular one
(11:14:33 PM) gavin: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/pki/resources/content/exceptionDialog.js?force=1#170
(11:14:49 PM) gavin: oh
(11:14:56 PM) gavin: sorry, right - maybe not that one
(11:15:05 PM) bz_sleep: let me put it another way
(11:15:09 PM) gavin: (I thought that code checked the exception type)
(11:15:12 PM) bz_sleep: if send() returned NS_ERROR_FAILURE, then....
(11:15:22 PM) bz_sleep: either that XHR was already in flight
(11:15:37 PM) bz_sleep: or various parts of building the request failed
(11:15:53 PM) bz_sleep: or it's a sync request and mChannel is null at the end of send()
(11:16:18 PM) bz_sleep: I guess it doesn't have to be a sync request; just have to have mChannel null at the end of send()
(11:16:42 PM) ericjung: i don't even see mChannel in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/pki/resources/content/exceptionDialog.js
(11:16:55 PM) bz_sleep: 180   if(req.channel && req.channel.securityInfo) {
(11:17:04 PM) bz_sleep: mChannel is a member of the C++ class that implements |req|
(11:17:12 PM) bz_sleep: 1071 nsXMLHttpRequest::GetChannel(nsIChannel **aChannel)
(11:17:13 PM) bz_sleep: 1072 {
(11:17:13 PM) bz_sleep: 1073   NS_ENSURE_ARG_POINTER(aChannel);
(11:17:13 PM) bz_sleep: 1074   NS_IF_ADDREF(*aChannel = mChannel);
(11:17:20 PM) bz_sleep: At http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp#1071
(11:17:30 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: so I think you have two options
(11:17:36 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: either you build a debug build and see what's up
(11:17:37 PM) ericjung: ?
(11:17:48 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: or you file a bug with str and cc me and I can take a quick look tomorrow
(11:18:04 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: I don't think trying to read the tea leaves will get you very far
(11:18:10 PM) ericjung: :)
(11:18:20 PM) ericjung: bz_sleep: thank you
(11:18:28 PM) ericjung: bz_sleep: you are very kind
(11:18:37 PM) bz_sleep: ericjung: just don't forget the steps to reproduce.  ;)
(11:18:38 PM) gavin: finding out which of the conditions on 180 fail would help...
(11:18:43 PM) ***bz_sleep sleeps for real
(11:18:48 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: my money is channel is null
(11:18:51 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: 99% sure
(11:18:58 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: given that NS_ERROR_FAILURE
(11:19:05 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: the question is why
(11:19:10 PM) ericjung: afk
(11:19:12 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: and that will be down in the xhr guts somewhere
(11:19:19 PM) gavin: what error is that code expecting, if not ERROR_FAILURE?
(11:19:45 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: I don't know
(11:20:06 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: but given the following code, I certainly hope it's not expecting a null channel!
(11:22:51 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: this code doesn't make much sense to me, honestly
(11:22:56 PM) bz_sleep: gavin: but that's ok
(11:22:57 PM) ***bz_sleep sleeps

Any help greatly appreciated--I'm at a loss as to how to progress.
