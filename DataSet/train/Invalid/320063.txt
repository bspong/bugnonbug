It looks like it's connecting to the X server prior to crashing.  When I run firefox without an X server to connect to, it craps out saying it cannot connect to X server, rather than SEGV'ing.  
If you can think of any other useful information, please feel free to ask.  

Some system information included below:

Firefox compiled with: gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 [FreeBSD] 20050518

System information:
FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE #1: Sun Dec 11 15:16:22 EST 2005    root@dolor:/usr/src/sys/sparc64/compile/DOLOR
Timecounter "tick" frequency 167002671 Hz quality 1000
real memory  = 134217728 (128 MB)
avail memory = 109330432 (104 MB)
cpu0: Sun Microsystems UltraSparc-I Processor (167.00 MHz CPU)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Executing firefox-bin (almost) immediately returns segmentation violation
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
firefox-bin exits without doing anything else which would be visible.  That is, no window is ever opened, and no other information is provided by firefox-bin prior to seg faulting and dying.


Expected Results:  
Displayed window and operated normally.

This has occured for me on a fresh build using the stable Firefox 1.5 source downloaded via the links proided on www.mozilla.org.  I believe the tarball was downloaded from ftp.mozilla.org, but I don't remember with 100% certainty.  

It has also been reported on the freebsd sparc64 bug system that firefox is behaving in this same manner when built via the FreeBSD ports system.  I also use Firefox 1.5 on FreeBSD systems running on the i386 platform with no such problems, so I'm going out on a limb and going to guess that this is an issue specific to the FreeBSD/SPARC64 platform.  

Information from the user trying to build via FreeBSD ports on sparc64 is available at this url: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=89486sparc64

Note that his bug report also indicates that this problem affects thunderbird.  I cannot corroborate this, as the only application I have built/attempted to use on FreeBSD/SPARC64 is the "browser" (firefox 1.5) application.
