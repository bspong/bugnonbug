bad header showing in browser window -- http 1.1 incompatibility with cached requests
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

In a continuing effort to provide enterprise level tools to our clients,
Omniture has written Sitecatalyst to be fully compatible with Mozilla browsers.
 It has come to our attention that there is an intermittent problem for our
clients with a known http 1.1 bug in Mozilla.  Please see the following link
which refers to what we believe to be a related issue.  

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/004370.html

The following is text taken from our testing environment showing the error that
occurs, where header information is displayed in the browser:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 29 Jun 2005 20:49:52 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix)

In our efforts to understand the issue we set the following in the http.conf on
our apache server:

BrowserMatch "Mozilla/5" downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

The problem was then no longer reproducible leading us to believe it is an http
1.1 incompatibility with Mozilla.  The primary differences in http 1.1 is its
ability to keep alive a persistent connection between the server and the
browser, and the compression of the data stream being transferred.  We notice
the error occurs when returning to a report, which suggests it could be an issue
dealing with cached pages.  The following is a quote from w3.org which may
address a possible hang up that Mozilla is having with http 1.1

To improve the perceived response time, a browser needs to learn basic size
information of each object in a page (required for page layout) as soon as
possible. The first bytes typically contain the image size. To achieve better
concurrency and retrieve the first few bytes of embedded links while still
receiving the bytes for the master document, HTTP/1.0 browsers usually use
multiple TCP connections. We believe by using range requests HTTP/1.1 clients
can achieve similar or better results over a single connection. 
HTTP /1.1 defines as part of the standard (and most current HTTP/1.0 servers
already implement) byte range facilities that allow a client to perform partial
retrieval of objects. The initial intent of range requests was to allow caching
proxy to finish interrupted transfers by requesting only the bytes of the
document they currently do not hold in their cache. 
To solve the problem that browsers need the size of embedded objects, we believe
that the natural revalidation request for HTTP/1.1 will combine both cache
validation headers and an If-Range request header, to prevent large objects from
monopolizing the connection to the server over its connection. The range
requested should be large enough to usually return any embedded metadata for the
object for the common data types. This capability of HTTP/1.1 is implicit in its
caching and range request design. 
When a browser revisits a page, it has a very good idea what the type of any
embedded object is likely to be, and can therefore both make a validation
request and also simultaneously request the metadata of the embedded object if
there has been any change. The metadata is much more valuable than the embedded
image data. Subsequently, the browser might generate requests for the rest of
the object, or for enough of each object to allow for progressive display of
image data types (e.g. progressive PNG, GIF or JPEG images), or to multiplex
between multiple large images on the page. We call this style of use of HTTP/1.1
"poor man's multiplexing." 
We believe cache validation combined with range requests will likely become a
very common idiom of HTTP/1.1. 


This issue has become a top priority for Omniture as many of our clients are
very high profile and they wish to access our tool with Mozilla.  We would like
to extend a hand of assistance in finding a final solution to this problem.  

Thank you,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with pipelined data, served from a web server using http 1.1.
2. Reload the now-cached page several times.
3. See the garbage header text in the browser.

We can reproduce this everytime, but it does not always occur on the the first
refresh.

Actual Results:  
We see the following header text in the browser content window:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 29 Jun 2005 20:49:52 GMT Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix)
mod_ssl/2.8.9 OpenSSL/0.9.6e xserver: www192 Set-Cookie:

Expected Results:  
We shouldn't see the header text and the header should have been handled correctly.
